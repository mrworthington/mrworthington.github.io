## General Note of Appreciation!

Thanks for helping us out with Champ! You have no idea how much we appreciate it! We'll be home later on Saturday evening, so no worries about anything beyond the instructions I describe for Saturday evening, 6-8PM. If we end up coming home sooner, I'll call ahead of time.

## Friday Evening Instructions

###Between 6-8PM

Take him for a short walk and feed him 1 scoop of dry food. He should have enough water, but if he doesn't, please fill his water bowl. No medicine for this meal.

> **Details for Walk & Food:** His collar and leash are usually near the door on the keyhook. The scoop and food sits behind the door in a dog food bag in our laundry room. His food and water bowl are in front of the laundry room on the ground. Water bowl is bigger than the food bowl.
    
###At 10PM 

Let champ out in the backyard so he can use the bathroom and then let him back in when he's done. He goes quick, so it shouldn't last long. After this, you can leave Champ inside and lock the house up. He'll just go to sleep and won't wake up until the morning.

> **Details:** None here. Just lock up.

## Saturday Morning Instructions

###Between 7AM-10AM

Take him for a short walk and feed him 1 scoop of dry food **with medicine & some wet food.**

> **Details for Medicine:** Champ takes 1 Colchicine tablet with his morning meal. 

> **Locating his Medicine:** The pill is usually behind the garbage bin on the lowest shelf of our kitchen pantry (door right of the fridge). Take only 1 pill and wrap it with some wet food. 

> **Locating his Wet Food:** The wet food is in a can on one of the lower door shelves of our fridge. I just grab a spoon (first drawer left of the fridge), wrap his pill with a bit of wet food, and throw it in with his dry food. After that, you can give him the bowl and he'll be good.

> **Details for Walk & Food:** Same as described from Friday

## Saturday Evening Instructions

Take him for a short walk and feed him 1 scoop of dry food. He should have enough water, but if he doesn't, please fill his water bowl. No medicine for this meal. 

> *Details for Walk & Food:* Same as before.
