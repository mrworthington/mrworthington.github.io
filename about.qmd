Originally from San Antonio, TX, I live in Austin with my wife, Jess, and our family. I serve as a commission member for the City of Austin's [Early Childhood Council](http://www.austintexas.gov/ecc) and as Vice-President of the [Del Valle Community Coalition](https://www.delvallecommunitycoalition.com). I am also a former candidate for the Texas Legislature in House District 51.

**Professional Background**: Most recently, I was the Senior Project Manager of Data Initiatives at [the LBJ School of Public Affairs](https://lbj.utexas.edu). I have also led data work for [Texas 2036](https://texas2036.org/data/) and [the United Way for Greater Austin](unitedwayaustin.org). Before my career in Data Science and Analytics, I worked as an educator for several years with [KIPP Austin Public Schools](http://www.kippaustin.org) and [DC Public Schools](https://dcps.dc.gov) in Washington, DC. At KIPP, I served as the Digital Learning Coordinator for the Austin region. In DC, I taught at MacFarland Middle School in DCPS where I served as a Literacy Intervention Specialist, Special Education Teacher, and IT Coordinator. When I moved to the DCPS Central Office, I worked as the Manager of Technology Strategy in the Office of the Chief Operating Officer. 

**Education Background**: I hold Master's degrees in Public Affairs from the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX) and in Education from George Mason University (Fairfax, VA). In my undergraduate life, I studied English at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, TX.

**Research & Personal Interests**: Having grown up in poverty and fatherless during adolescence, my policy interests explore the intersections of poverty, public health, and public education. My non-policy interests center around my wife and our family, our friends, our church ([Vox Veniae](http://voxveniae.com/)), getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and [the San Antonio Spurs](https://twitter.com/mrworthington/lists/spurs-watch).
