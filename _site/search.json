      "contents": "\nOriginally from San Antonio, TX, I live in Austin with my wife, Jess, and our family. Currently, I am the Senior Project Manager of Data Initiatives at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. In addition, I serve as a commission member for the City of Austin’s Early Childhood Council.\nProfessional Background: Prior to now, I have led data work for Texas 2036 and the United Way for Greater Austin. Before my career in Data Science and Analytics, I worked as an educator for several years with KIPP Austin Public Schools and DC Public Schools in Washington, DC. At KIPP, I served as the Digital Learning Coordinator for the Austin region. In DC, I taught at MacFarland Middle School in DCPS where I served as a Literacy Intervention Specialist, Special Education Teacher, and IT Coordinator. When I moved to the DCPS Central Office, I worked as the Manager of Technology Strategy in the Office of the Chief Operating Officer.\nEducation Background: I hold Master’s degrees in Public Affairs from the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX) and in Education from George Mason University (Fairfax, VA). In my undergraduate life, I studied English at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, TX.\nResearch & Personal Interests: Having grown up in poverty and fatherless during adolescence, my policy interests explore the intersections of poverty, public health, and public education. My non-policy interests center around my wife and our family, our friends, our church (Vox Veniae), getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n\n\n",

San Antonio ISD worked its way through the courts in 1968, transcripts of Civil Rights hearings revealed a deeper logic at work in San Antonio and the country that sought to disenfranchise Mexican-Americans in almost every facet of life.↩︎\nArticle Description: Reforms of the mid- and late-20th century offered opportunities for some school districts to shore up their property tax base and create more secure funding. Edgewood, however, would not be one of these.↩︎\nArticle Description: The struggles that continue to plague Edgewood ISD are rooted in prejudice. Throughout the 20th century, those prejudices became public policy that would allocate services unevenly across the city, creating intractable inequities still visible in the city’s school districts.↩︎\nServing as one of four panelists in a one-hour live radio broadcast for Texas Public Radio’s “The Source”, I discussed the future of Texas Public Education and School Finance along with Texas State Representative Diego Bernal & San Antonio ISD Chief Innovation Officer Mohammed Choudhury. Texas Public Radio’s David Martin Davies moderated the live radio panel.↩︎\nArticle Description: Forty-four years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that children have no fundamental right to receive an education in a case involving families from a San Antonio school district called Edgewood ISD. This piece explains how Texas’ school finance system helped perpetuate nationwide inequity.↩︎\nArticle Description: In a thirty-minute one-on-one interview for Texas Public Radio’s “Texas Matters” podcast, I describe the history behind America’s lack of a federal right to an education with David Martin Davies of Texas Public Radio. We talk about 1968, redlining in San Antonio, Kelly Air Force base, and other factors that prompted Folo Media’s interest in writing about Rodriguez v. San Antonio ISD.↩︎\nIn a guest post for The Expectations Project, I broke down how even though President Trump’s budget isn’t legally binding, it promoted an ideas that were in direct conflict with my identity as a Christian and a former public school teacher.↩︎\nIn March 2016, served on a panel with the former Governor of North Carolina, Bev Purdue, and Kerry Gallagher, Digital Learning Specialist at St John’s Preparatory School, to discuss solutions to emerging challenges in education policy at the local, state, and federal policy levels. (Austin, TX)↩︎\nIn February 2016, served as a guest blogger for Rick Hess’ (AEI) “Straight Up” Column. Offered three considerations schools should make in an effort to better address the growing diversity of students’ college and career readiness needs through technology.↩︎\nIn February of 2016, had a great conversation with Talk Story where we discussed a bit of my background growing up and the importance of giving marginalized communities space for their voices rather than having other people tell their stories.↩︎\nIn December 2015, I was asked by Sojourners Magazine to write a reflection on my brother’s response to a hateful meme involving one of my friends from High School through the lens of the Christian season of advent.↩︎\nOn May 9, 2015, provided the perspective of an education institution regarding equity and diversity in education technology alongside a panel made of education technology executives and a journalist. (Kansas City, KS)↩︎\nIn 2012 and 2014, taught seminars for graduating college seniors that explored relevant issues and considerations for transitioning to professional life at the intersection of faith and public service, sponsored by the Coalition for Christian Outreach college ministry. (Pittsburgh, PA)↩︎\nOn July 30, 2014, explored best practices in engaging teachers and academic leaders in blended learning alongside KIPP DC and KIPP Bay Area.

(Washington, DC)↩︎\nIn 2011, delivered a two part presentation to church practitioners from across the world called “Other People’s Children” that explored outcomes of students in low income communities and various opportunities for the church to radically improve the circumstances of neighborhood schools. (Abilene, TX)↩︎\nOn April 2, 2011, served with Nicole Baker Fulgham (then Vice President of Teacher For America and current CEO of The Expecations Project) and Barbara Schoenly, Board Member of inFocus, to discuss how faith drives our choice of profession and what students of faith should consider when entering public service. (Cambridge, MA)↩︎\nIn November of 2010, delivered two 45-minute keynotes exploring opportunities for faith communities to positively impact America’s most struggling schools. (Johnson City, TN)↩︎\nIn 2008, published a reflectional piece on proposed attitudes the Churches of Christ should adopt towards racial reconciliation.\n\n↩︎\n",
