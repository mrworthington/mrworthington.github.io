    "text": "Note: This story was originally published by Folo Media.\nIn case you missed it: Matt Worthington joined State Rep. Diego Bernal and SAISD’s Chief Innovation Officer Mohammad Choudhury on TPR’s The Source to discuss school finance in San Antonio. Listen to their conversation here.\nForty-four years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that children have no fundamental right to receive an education. If you never knew that, you aren’t alone — people are surprised when they discover this little-known piece of American history.\nIf you’re from San Antonio, you may be further surprised to know that this history was born right here, in the city’s West Side.\nRoe v. Wade got all the headlines in 1973, but just three months after that landmark decision, the Supreme Court reached another landmark 5-4 decision: San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, in which a group of San Antonio families from the Edgewood community lost their years-long fight for equal education. The court’s majority found that the school finance system, which was based on property taxes and resulted in stark inequalities between schools, was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Education finance has been re-litigated multiple times at the state level, but it remains one of the key legal reasons that extreme inequalities persist in American schools today.\nThough I was born and raised in San Antonio, I didn’t become familiar with the Rodriguez case until after I moved to Washington, D.C. in 2009 and began teaching students with disabilities in DC Public Schools. After landing the job, I learned the school had been reconstituted, which meant the district wanted to start over from scratch. Except the only thing replaced was the staff. The archaic facilities and its existing resources were still mostly outdated, incomplete or unorganized. Depending on the classroom, any number of concerns could be found — broken phones, disconnected intercoms, overhead projectors with no light bulbs, computers with tattered keyboards, and ceilings that dripped with bad weather. And then there was our disheveled library, repeated pest problems, and occasional breaks in water lines that left us without clean water for hours at a time.\nWhen I learned about the Rodriguez case, a wave of shock and depression washed over me as I realized that schools like mine were deemed legally acceptable learning environments for children. More difficult was understanding that this reality spanned across multiple decades, starting with a district from my hometown in a case I had never heard about growing up.\nThe case’s roots trace back to spring 1968, when Mexican-American families from the Edgewood District Concerned Parents Association hired a lawyer named Arthur Gochman to investigate legal action regarding a number of concerns they had with the conditions their children were forced to endure. Those children felt the concerns, too, and on May 16, 1968, 400 Edgewood High School students walked out at the 10 a.m. bell. Their protest called attention to antiquated curricula, the mistreatment of students, abysmal facilities, and consistently poor funding.\nThe Edgewood families—–represented by Demetrio Rodriguez (pictured above), who worked at Kelly Air Force Base and had children attending Edgewood schools—claimed that the Texas school funding methods, which are determined by property taxes, were responsible for Edgewood’s inferior quality as a district. Low property values doomed kids to bad schools, so Edgewood was powerless to change its circumstances.\nThe State of Texas responded by claiming it provided “a minimum” education, which was all they were legally required to do. In the oral arguments, Gochman pressed the court to consider what was at stake if the court ruled in favor of “minimums” and against the Edgewood families.\nAmerica, he said, risked endorsing a dual-class society where some have access to real opportunity and others do not.\nGochman argued passionately on behalf of poor children living in the most resource-deprived school districts of San Antonio. According to news reports of the trial, a victory for Rodriguez and the Edgewood families seemed almost inevitable to those monitoring it closely. Governors and other state legislators braced for what Justice Lewis Powell later said would have been “an unprecedented upheaval in public education.” As the New York Times reported at the time: “Every state has studies under way, and many have passed or are considering legislation to eliminate” the fundamental inequalities in the U.S. system of school finance.\nBut the disruption never came. On March 21, 1973, the court ruled against Demetrio Rodriguez and the other Mexican American families from Edgewood. Education, they found, is not explicitly enumerated in the constitution as a right, so it could not be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nYet, even as it denied equality in education, the court said it highly valued education. In the majority opinion written by Justice Powell, the court reaffirmed its contention from Brown v. Board of Education that “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.” The court even described the unjust character of America’s education system. It never reasoned that the way the U.S. funds education was fair or sensible.\nAs Justice Potter Stewart wrote, “The method of financing public schools in Texas, as in almost every other State, has resulted in a system of public education that can fairly be described as chaotic and unjust. It does not follow, however, and I cannot find, that this system violates the Constitution of the United States.”\nThe American education system was not fair. It was merely constitutional.\nSince 1973, we have tried to fix education in many ways. We have tried fixing standards, teachers, school leaders, students, parents, tests, and everything in between. Two fixes we’ve never called for: Amending the constitution to protect the right to an education, and transforming school finance systems that courts since Rodriguez have continued to condemn. To this day, in case after case, courts call our education finance system “unjust,” “Byzantine,” and “awful” — but not unconstitutional.\nI’ve spent the last few months exploring the legacy of the Rodriguez case. It’s a famous case within education circles, but has not received anything near the attention of, say, Roe v. Wade. Even most people from San Antonio have likely never heard of it, just like me until a few years back. But as I’ve learned, both the history and after-effects of Rodriguez are extremely illuminating. The story of Rodriguez has a lot to teach us. Each of those events or conversations provides insight into the present vulnerabilities felt across Texas and San Antonio.\nIn the weeks ahead, I’ll be writing a series of essays about the Texas school finance system. It’s complicated stuff, but this issue is essential because of how it directly impacts so many people across Texas. My aim is to make the issue accessible — and to show how this “chaotic and unjust” system shapes the deep inequalities of possibility that threaten countless families and children today.\nNote: Photos of Demetrio Rodriguez are provided by Gil Barrera / Courtesy UTSA Special Collections"

One of the key pieces of feedback I received from this post was to look into looping and interation. As a result, I learned about a package called {purrr}, which was a great solution for this recommendation.\nThis evening, the Ed Trust is hosting a discussion on twitter at 8PM ET on school funding inequity, so I thought I would do a code-through of a visualization I made this past summer while researching the legacy of a famous school finance Supreme Court case that ended up determining that Americans had no fundamental right to an education. In short, it shows the shares of funding over time for each of the three main sources of funding for public education in America: federal funding, state funding, and local funding (mostly property taxes)."

Read the first and second essays.\nBy 1960, residential and public housing segregation had effectively consolidated San Antonio’s Hispanic residents on the West Side, where more than half lived in 18 of the city’s 92 census tracts. In nine of those tracts, nearly half of the housing was categorized by the federal government as “deteriorating” or “dilapidated,” the latter of which was deemed hazardous to occupants’ health and safety.\nWith unemployment rates nearly double the city’s, and with almost half of its residents without stable employment, West Side median incomes ranged from 29 to 60 percent of white incomes. Many industries limited the type of jobs black and Hispanic workers could do. As a result, nearly half the population on the West Side lived below the federal poverty line, which left a quarter of residents chronically hungry.\nInterviews from a 1968 United States Commission on Civil Rights investigation reveal widespread discrimination against Hispanic people in San Antonio. Parents and students expressed frustration as they saw another generation of bright and capable children denied the opportunity to thrive. One student at Lanier High School described college as “an impossible dream.”\nLanier High School in San Antonio ISD would struggle with internal inequality within its district, but neighboring Edgewood ISD had been thoroughly isolated.\nEdgewood became the poster child for what writer Jonathan Kozol would call “Savage Inequalities” in his 1991 book of the same name. It was not only the poorest district in Texas at the time, but the poorest district in America’s 16 largest cities.\nWhat is most troubling is that 70 years prior, some in Texas had predicted exactly this."

    "text": "This is the fourth and final installment in a series of essays on the legacy of Rodriguez v. San Antonio ISD — a court battle that began in San Antonio and ended in the Supreme Court — and determined that American children have no constitutional right to an education. Read the first, second and third essays.\nIn 1968, Bexar County Commissioner A.J. Plough sat down with CBS News to discuss the plight of Latinos living in hunger and poverty on San Antonio’s West Side.\nPlough: “Well, why are they not getting enough food? Because the father won’t work. And I mean, won’t work. If they won’t work, do you expect the taxpayer to raise all the kids … ’cause their daddies won’t work? First, let’s do something with the daddies and then, yes, take care of the kids.\nThe reporter asked how chronically hungry students could be expected to learn on an empty stomach.\n“Well, what do you mean learn properly in school? Do you really need school… other than, say, an eighth grade education?” Plough said, later adding, “People keep talking about this education, ‘a college education.’ It’s not necessary.”\nMeanwhile, the same disparities that prompted the CBS interview caught the attention of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, which held hearings that same year in San Antonio to collect information regarding civil rights violations against Mexican-American families in the Southwest. What they found reveals how racism shaped society in the 20th century here and across the United States.\nIn total, the commission spent six months in San Antonio and interviewed more than 1,000 residents to understand these challenges in the context of housing, education, employment, voting and justice.\nContrary to the analysis of Plough and others, the Commission found that Hispanic parents desperately wanted good jobs, their children wanted to earn college degrees, and both wanted to eat three meals a day in decent housing. However, the education system and public infrastructure failed them. Parents faced discrimination in the workplace. Their upward mobility was further restricted by exclusionary real estate and lending practices. Using racially restrictive housing covenants white residents prohibited Black and Hispanic families from purchasing homes in multiple neighborhoods across the city. Such was unvarnished racism in mid-century America. Discrimination was not problematic, and equity was not a priority.\nAs a result of these attitudes, economic development, which increased property values and neighborhood resources, was unevenly distributed. Until 1977, San Antonio’s City Council was entirely made up of members who could live anywhere in the city, and the Northside was most heavily represented. Major investments like the South Texas Medical Center and the University of Texas at San Antonio directed the city’s continued growth to the north. Meanwhile, the parts of town where black and Hispanic families were contained — the East, West and South Sides — were further devalued by neglect of aging and absent infrastructure.\nPolitical, economic and social exclusion worked in concert to create an intractable disadvantage that still clings to the heels of ambitious and bright Hispanic students decades later. While few in 2017 would espouse overt racism, the damning testimony recorded by the Civil Rights commission has yet to be fully rectified."

    "section": "Transcript of My Testimony",
    "text": "Transcript of My Testimony\nMy name is Matt Worthington and I am a resident of Austin, TX; parent of two girls; former special education teacher; and a former district technology administrator of DC Public Schools and KIPP Austin Public Schools who holds a Masters in Education and am nearing completion of a second Master’s in Public Affairs from the LBJ School at the University of Texas.\nMembers of the committee: Texas schools are getting poorer faster than they’re getting bigger. Between 1995 & 2016, the share of students identified as economically disadvantaged in traditional ISDs rose by almost 13%1. In raw numbers, that translates to an 83% increase in the total number of economically disadvantaged students from 1995 to 2016. This is because the increase of poor students is outpacing the overall population growth of students.2\nThe current body of medical & economic research on child poverty tells us that poverty exposes children to what is called “toxic stress”. This adversity has strong linear relationships with multiple health impairments in adulthood, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, alcoholism, and depression.3 They reduce life expectancies for children. Counter that, one of the more significant explanations for long life-expectancies is local government spending.4\nIn Texas, school poverty disproportionately effects students of color. In 2014, almost half of the non-white student population in Texas attended high-poverty schools, which generally have greater academic, social, and emotional needs but receive inadequate funding for programming.5\nMeanwhile, the state has lowered its share of per-pupil funding on traditional ISDs. Since 2008, the state’s funding has dipped by almost $500 per ADA while local property tax funding has skyrocketed at over $800 per ADA. Multiplied by the respective ADA counts of students in 2016, this shift constitutes an increased burden of roughly $4.3 billion for statewide local property tax funding and a decreased responsibility of roughly $2.5 billion for funding from the state.6\nData: Texas Education Agency - PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports; accessed via a public information request. \nWhile recapture was designed to provide equity, it has been undermined by the state’s supplanting of revenues that it claims to supplement. Detailed records of recapture revenues show an over 800% increase in annual collections since 1994, but the state maintains no accounting method that tracks exactly7 where recapture money goes, by district. In other words, the public cannot see where the money ends up.\nIncreasingly, poor districts are running out of ways to get more revenue. Nearly 43% of property poor districts have maxed out on their M&O rates compared to only 14% of property wealthy districts.8 This means poor districts are increasingly reliant on the hope for more funding from recapture. However, this hope is fragile because most property wealthy districts tax on M&O within their range of golden pennies, which is not subject to recapture.9 This is because many property wealthy districts do not trust the state as a fiduciary of recapture revenues.\nIf we fail to ensure that all 5.3 million children in Texas attend schools that are adequately and transparently funded, we risk a future where Texas is characterized by its lack moral, economic, or cultural wealth. That will happen if we fail to ensure that money intended for poor children actually makes its way to those classrooms where they are learning against all odds. If that means we, as Texas taxpayers, must pay more money than so be it. The lives of 5.3 million children and future generations of Texans literally depend upon it.\nThank you."

    "text": "Approaching the six-month mark of COVID-19 in Texas, one of the more common topics of discussion I hear is what the effects of coronavirus on our communities reveals about the world that existed before. And where we knew little about COVID-19 back in March, since that time a lot has been documented about what increases the risk of not only becoming severely ill, but also what increases the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 before you even get sick—such as having a job that requires you to be physically present for work (as opposed to working remotely from home) or not having access to a reliable internet connection.\nThat said, I want to explore some of these things in a series of blog posts–to see who is not only getting COVID, but also where folks are most at risk of being exposed to COVID and where they’re most at risk of not bouncing back. The trouble in answering these questions is that getting good data is difficult and, once you have it, organizing the data in a way that is useful and meaningful for others is even harder. So, I’m going to pace myself and search for datasets that can inform our conversation. For the purposes of these blog posts, I’m just going to focus on looking at the city-wide data in Austin—where I live—because I know all the data exists with regards to the questions I have pulled together. If you have questions, I invite you to ask them as well and I’ll do my best to find data that can help provided some meaningful insight."

    "text": "Who is getting COVID-19 in Austin?\nBefore we do any exploration of the more complicated questions identified, the best starting point would be exploring where COVID is occuring most in Austin. So let’s look at that before digging into other questions and start by pulling Austin Public Health’s data—which organizes cases at the zip code level and updated frequently—to map out cases. We don’t have access to where deaths occur most often, but cases at the zip code level is more than you can find in a lot of places. So we’ll use what we have.\nHere’s where cases are occurring most often right now:\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that cases are largely consolidated east of I-35. Without additional context, it’s worth wondering what role an interstate plays in shielding folks on one side from Coronavirus. With additional context about how the city was intentionally segregated through a “master plan” developed in 1928 that used I-35 as a form of physical division, it’s worth paying attention to the dynamics of I-35 and including it as a geographical marker throughout future analyses.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, I would highly recommend reading through this analysis by the Austin Statesman on the role of I-35 in the city’s history of racial segregation, as a starting point. Other histories have been documented elsewhere, but this is a good starting point.\n\nIn the next few blog posts, I’ll be writing about risk + resilience. Originally, I wanted to include everything here, but the charts and analysis became pretty extensive. For fear of exhausting everyone, including myself. We’ll take these questions piece by piece.\nNext Blogpost: Who should be most worried about getting COVID?\nNote about this series: If you’re interested in asking specific questions to explore in this, reach out to me via Facebook or Twitter and I’ll do my best to find data that can help provide some kind of meaningful answer.\nWhere can I find the code for this blog? Once I clean up the mess in this repo, I’ll make it public on github. For now, I’m happy to share individual the Rmarkdown file used to produce each article.\n\n\nTLDR | Why not do this at the statewide level?\n\nOriginally, I considered focusing these articles at the statewide level for Texas, but I kept running into issues around finding data that could meaningfully answer some of my questions. The reasons for this are many, but some of the state’s existing COVID-19 data cannot be aggregated at anything beyond the statewide level for reasons outside of their control.\n\nExample - Test Positivity\nFor example, county-level test positivity is one of those things that has been difficult because COVID-19 lab testing has largely been decentralized, with over 97% of tests being conducted in commercial labs. Consequently, this means the state has to then coordinate data from over 4 million tests conducted outside of state testing labs.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Number of People Tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Texas, By Lab Type\n    \n    \n      Source: Texas Department of State Health Services | As of August 10th at 3:00PM CST1\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Location\n      Tests Processed\n    \n  \n  \n    \nTotal People Tested in Texas by Public Health Lab\n122.02K\n    \nNo. Tests by Commercial labs*\n4.49M\n    Total Tests\n—\n4,611,777\n  \n  \n    \n      *Unable to deduplicate figures for Commercial labs.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Data: From the 'Accessible Dashboard Data' File, under the 'Tests' tab.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAnd given that these commercial labs aren’t actually part of a state agency, this means they have to learn new reporting rhythms and do work that, perhaps, they didn’t plan for or know they needed to do–such as keep all of the positives and negatives for each county, record those in a database by the county of origin, deduplicate them by the person who got the test, and then share all of that information back to the state in a manner that is uniform with all the other private labs in the state.\nThat said, not being able to compare how much a county is testing with how much they’re testing positive weakens a potential analysis and limits how much you can explore the dynamics between risk factors and things like test positivity.\n\n\nExample - Demographic Data\nAnother example of this information is demographic data about cases and fatalities. That information also doesn’t exist broken down by county–sometimes due to HIPAA requirements.\nSo if you wanted to analyze geographic COVID-19 trends between counties across multiple pieces of data such as demographic, known risk-factors, and other trends, you’d have a hard time accomplishing that because it currently doesn’t exist.\nFor that reason, I’ve chosen to just focus on using city-level data given that cities tend to have better access to local information about their communities."
