    "text": "At RStudio (Posit) Conference this year, I realized I‚Äôd been dealing with a bit of impostor syndrome while sitting at a Birds of a Feather table for folks interested in spatial data. As I sat there, I started asking people about their spatial work and had largely assumed people knew more than I did. In part, this is because I‚Äôve learned so many things from folks sharing through the #rstats hashtag on twitter and assumed people at the conference were just all farther down the line in the development of their skills than I was.\nThe reality was that most folks at my table were there because they were interested in learning how to work with Spatial Data in R and I was the only one at my table who had experience and background, so folks asked for some resources and direction on how to get going with Spatial Data in R. For those at the table, I gave a very impromptu demo and walk through of core tools in my spatial workflow that a lot of people liked. Afterwards, some folks asked if I could share resources. So this post (or possibly series of posts?) is a response to that.\nAt the core of my imposter syndrome was assuming folks already knew most of the stuff I did and, therefore, there wasn‚Äôt much of a need for me to share. So, at least with regards to spatial data, I‚Äôll try to be better about contributing to folks in the #rstats community online by sharing about different things."

    "text": "Second Question: Are R tools any kind of good for Sptial/GIS workflows?\nAbsolutely. Positively. Definitely yes. R is fan-freaking-tastic for a ton of random stuff, but it is especially amazing when it comes to spatial work. In fact, one of the reasons I‚Äôve come to love R so much is how simplified workflows are, regardless of how complicated the data may be.\nI often think back on a grad school GIS Course in 2017, where I first learned how to make maps. The workflows involved downloading separate spatial/numeric data files and required multiple pieces of software1 and hours of time to join those data, design the map, and export that map to a format you could use in a report or public-facing document. And that was really only static maps that end up in printed or PDF reports. Interactive workflows was an entirely different beast that required even more expensive software and other skills.\nIn contrast, consider the map below, which is built in this document. The code chunk below pulls the spatial and numeric data from its source (NCES Open Data) and visualizes it int in about 10 lines of code. More impressive is that even though it contains over 100,000 school locations across the country, it‚Äôs very fast. Use your mouse/trackpad to hover the dots and zoom in-and-out."

    "text": "How you do this in R | Feat. {rdeck}\n\nTo do this in R, it‚Äôs pretty simple. First, you go to the website where the data lives. Ironically, it‚Äôs on ArcGIS‚Äôs publishing platform, which lets us know there‚Äôs too many data points to display without zooming in. The good news is you don‚Äôt need ArcGIS to use the data.\nAnyway, to use the data, you just click on the gold-colored ‚ÄúI want to use this‚Äù button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar in the Step 1 screenshot. Once you‚Äôve clicked on that, copy the URL from the ‚ÄúGeoJSON‚Äù link under ‚ÄúView API Resources‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Screenshot of NCES School Locations Data (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Screenshot of NCES School Locations Data (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôve copied this code, you can read that spatial data directly into R with a function called read_sf() from the sf package.  Once you read that url into read_sf(), you can drop any empty spatial data from the geometry column (where all the spatial coordinates live for each dot) and then give the map a standard CRS to use across all dots.If you‚Äôre not familiar with sf, it‚Äôs what convinced me that, for the rest of my life, I never needed to pay for GIS software.\nHere‚Äôs what this looks like as code, and it‚Äôs just seven lines of code. You run this, you get the data, and now you‚Äôre ready to move on.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Core R Tools\nlibrary(sf) # Core Spatial Package. Pretty much replaces ArcGIS for most spatial tasks.\nsf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)\n\nurl <- \"https://services1.arcgis.com/Ua5sjt3LWTPigjyD/arcgis/rest/services/Public_School_Location_201819/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson\"\n\ndata <- read_sf(url) |>\n  drop_na(geometry) |>\n  st_as_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))\nAt this point, we are ready to map the data. Now, there‚Äôs lots of spatial packages out there to map with like leaflet, mapview , mapdeck, tmap, and {leafgl}, but I‚Äôve recently become a huge fan of a an R package called rdeck. I‚Äôm partial to it because it‚Äôs incredibly lightweight and the maps look really great once you‚Äôve gotten a token from mapbox studio, even though you don‚Äôt necessarily need one. For more on getting a mapbox token, see Kyle Walker‚Äôs tutorial from his {mapboxapi} R package.\nSo how do we map in {rdeck}? Well, let‚Äôs pretend like you didn‚Äôt have a mapbox token. You could start by running a code chunk, like the one below, which has two functions from rdeck.\nThe first function, rdeck(...) is kind of like the ggplot() function. It creates a spatial canvas, which you can modify with a few arguments. In this case, we‚Äôve articulated that there‚Äôs no base map, but the overall theme of the map is ‚Äúlight‚Äù.\nThe second function, add_scatterplot_layer() is what we use to add the dots and define characteristics about them. In this case, it just adds the school dots, names the dot series ‚ÄúPublic Schools (SY21-22)‚Äù, and tells it where to get the dots from within our dataset (the column labeled geometry)\n\nShow the code | Building A Basic Map`library(rdeck) # Loads rdeck library\n\nrdeck(map_style = NULL,\n      theme = \"light\") |>\n  add_scatterplot_layer(data = school_sites,\n                        name = \"Public Schools (SY21-22)\",\n                        get_position = geometry)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we improve this map?\nThe map above is a decent start, but there‚Äôs a couple of issues to resolve:\n\nThe dots kind of disappear as you zoom in.\nThe default bounding box is set more far out than I‚Äôd like.\nI also can‚Äôt really see any information about the schools.\nThe lack of a basemap may not be a problem for some maps, but for this one‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just not great.\n\nTo fix this, we just add a few arguments to each of the two functions used in the previous code chunk.\nStyling our dots\nFirst, I‚Äôm going to style the dots. They look cool from far away, but appear to dissolve once you zoom in. This is the opposite of what we want if our goal is to let people explore the US and identify schools across the country. So, to fix this, we can use a couple of arguments within the existing add_scatterplot_layer() function.\nWe start by setting a minimum pixel size for the dots using radius_min_pixels. Leaving it blank will mean there‚Äôs no minimum as people zoom in. Setting it to 1 or 2 pixels will mean people will see a dot equivalent to those sizes no matter how far they zoom in.\nI‚Äôm also going to make the dots burnt orange, cause I‚Äôm a UT Austin alum ü§ò and think it‚Äôs a great color üòÇ. Lastly, I‚Äôm going to set the opacity of the dots. There‚Äôs some other arguments within the function you can play with, but I feel pretty good about these dots. They are visible and big enough to hover over with a mouse.\nAt this point, we only need to add a basemap, tooltip, and bounding box so the map doesn‚Äôt render so far out (leaving a lot of white space).\n\nShow the code | Styling The Dotsrdeck(map_style = NULL,\n      theme = \"light\") |>\n  add_scatterplot_layer(data = school_sites,\n                        name = \"Public Schools (SY21-22)\",\n                        get_position = geometry,\n                        get_fill_color = \"#bf5700\",\n                        radius_min_pixels = 2,\n                        opacity = 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a tooltip\nAdding a tooltip is actually pretty easy and the pre-built tooltips are quite nice. In my office, I‚Äôm going to adjust the existing data argument already set to our school_sites object and select only the Name and Location columns. They‚Äôre named differently, but I can rename them with school_sites |> select(Name=NAME, Location = NMCBSA). After this, you add a tooltip argument to define what columns you want. A nice feature of the tooltip argument is that you can use tidy-select syntax to build your tooltip. Lastly, I add pickable = TRUE, which just means that the dots will respond as I move my mouse/trackpad around the map.\nIf you want, you can add some CSS afterwards, but it‚Äôs a little complicated to adjust and the default tooltips are easy to set and look good. Alright, onto basemaps and bounding boxes.\n\nShow the code | Adding A Tooltiprdeck(map_style = NULL,\n      theme = \"light\") |>\n  add_scatterplot_layer(data = school_sites |> select(Name=NAME, Location = NMCBSA),\n                        name = \"Public Schools (SY21-22)\",\n                        get_position = geometry,\n                        get_fill_color = \"#b57000\",\n                        radius_min_pixels = 4,\n                        opacity = 0.3,\n                        tooltip = c(Name, Location),\n                        pickable = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a basemap\nAdding a basemap is easy once you get your token setup. Instead of setting map_style = NULL inside therdeck() function we‚Äôre currently, we just use one of the options from mapbox built into rdeck. For demonstration purposes, I‚Äôll use a style from mapbox called ‚ÄúLe Shine‚Äù by setting map_style = mapbox_gallery_le_shine(). In the original map, we use a style called ‚ÄúMinimo‚Äù, which I like and think works well to contrast basic geographic markers alongside the kind of dots we‚Äôre trying to visualize.\nNext up, bounding boxes!\n\nShow the code | Adding A Basemaprdeck(map_style = mapbox_gallery_le_shine(),\n      theme = \"light\") |>\n  add_scatterplot_layer(data = school_sites |> select(Name=NAME, Location = NMCBSA),\n                        name = \"Public Schools (SY21-22)\",\n                        get_position = geometry,\n                        get_fill_color = \"#b57000\",\n                        radius_min_pixels = 4,\n                        opacity = 0.3,\n                        tooltip = c(Name, Location))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a bounding box\nHonestly, this one is kind of tricky and might be the least intuitive part of rdeck because the argument that controls this initial_bounds requires an object of st_bbox, sf, sfc class. The end result spits out a box of coordinates that looks like this:\n      xmin       ymin       xmax       ymax \n-106.64585   25.83706  -93.50782   36.50045 \nThe disclaimer here is that you don‚Äôt have to set a bounding box to adjust the view, but it certainly helps if you want to direct your audience to a specific location. I sort of hacked my way through this by piece-mealing a frankestein function of different things I found online called get_bbox(), largely based on Bob Rudis‚Äô {nominatim} package. I‚Äôve folded the code here, but feel free to look at if you want. The bottom line is it works, so just steal it and use it to get the bounding box you need for this argument.\n\nShow the code | Adding a Bounding Boxget_bbox <- function(place) {\n\n  df_bbox <- nominatim::bb_lookup(place)\n\n  btlr <- df_bbox[1,c(\"bottom\", \"top\", \"left\", \"right\")]\n\n  v <- as.numeric(btlr)\n  cmat <- matrix(v[c(3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2)], nrow = 4)\n  spobj <- sp::SpatialPoints(coords = cmat)\n  sfobj <- sf::st_as_sfc(spobj)\n  sf::st_crs(sfobj) <- 4326\n  bbox <- sf::st_bbox(sfobj)\n\n  bbox\n\n}\n\ntexas_bbox <- get_bbox(\"Texas\")\n\n\nIn my case, I‚Äôm from Texas. I love Texas. And I want to focus the map on Texas. Not just cause I love it and am from here, but Texas is home to a significant chunk of America‚Äôs school-aged children. Of the reported 49.5 million children enrolled in US public schools, Texas accounts for over 5.4 million of them. So, I‚Äôm going to pass the result of my get_bbox() object into the initial_bounds argument of the rdeck() function, which will set the starting point to Texas.\n\nShow the code | Pitting It All Togetherrdeck(map_style = mapbox_gallery_minimo(),\n      initial_bounds = texas_bbox,\n      theme = \"light\") |>\n  add_scatterplot_layer(data = school_sites |> select(Name=NAME, Location = NMCBSA),\n                        visible = TRUE,\n                        visibility_toggle = TRUE,\n                        pickable = TRUE,\n                        antialiasing = TRUE,\n                        name = \"Public Schools (SY21-22)\",\n                        get_position = geometry,\n                        tooltip = c(Name, Location),\n                        get_fill_color = \"#bf5700\",\n                        radius_min_pixels = 2,\n                        blending_mode = \"normal\",\n                        opacity = 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n And that‚Äôs it!

    "text": "Note: This story was originally published by Folo Media.\nIn case you missed it: Matt Worthington joined State Rep.¬†Diego Bernal and SAISD‚Äôs Chief Innovation Officer Mohammad Choudhury on TPR‚Äôs The Source to discuss school finance in San Antonio. Listen to their conversation here.\nForty-four years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that children have no fundamental right to receive an education. If you never knew that, you aren‚Äôt alone ‚Äî people are surprised when they discover this little-known piece of American history.\nIf you‚Äôre from San Antonio, you may be further surprised to know that this history was born right here, in the city‚Äôs West Side.\nRoe v. Wade got all the headlines in 1973, but just three months after that landmark decision, the Supreme Court reached another landmark 5-4 decision: San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, in which a group of San Antonio families from the Edgewood community lost their years-long fight for equal education. The court‚Äôs majority found that the school finance system, which was based on property taxes and resulted in stark inequalities between schools, was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment‚Äôs equal protection clause. Education finance has been re-litigated multiple times at the state level, but it remains one of the key legal reasons that extreme inequalities persist in American schools today.\nThough I was born and raised in San Antonio, I didn‚Äôt become familiar with the Rodriguez case until after I moved to Washington, D.C. in 2009 and began teaching students with disabilities in DC Public Schools. After landing the job, I learned the school had been reconstituted, which meant the district wanted to start over from scratch. Except the only thing replaced was the staff. The archaic facilities and its existing resources were still mostly outdated, incomplete or unorganized. Depending on the classroom, any number of concerns could be found ‚Äî broken phones, disconnected intercoms, overhead projectors with no light bulbs, computers with tattered keyboards, and ceilings that dripped with bad weather. And then there was our disheveled library, repeated pest problems, and occasional breaks in water lines that left us without clean water for hours at a time.\nWhen I learned about the Rodriguez case, a wave of shock and depression washed over me as I realized that schools like mine were deemed legally acceptable learning environments for children. More difficult was understanding that this reality spanned across multiple decades, starting with a district from my hometown in a case I had never heard about growing up.\nThe case‚Äôs roots trace back to spring 1968, when Mexican-American families from the Edgewood District Concerned Parents Association hired a lawyer named Arthur Gochman to investigate legal action regarding a number of concerns they had with the conditions their children were forced to endure. Those children felt the concerns, too, and on May 16, 1968, 400 Edgewood High School students walked out at the 10 a.m. bell. Their protest called attention to antiquated curricula, the mistreatment of students, abysmal facilities, and consistently poor funding.\nThe Edgewood families‚Äî‚Äìrepresented by Demetrio Rodriguez (pictured above), who worked at Kelly Air Force Base and had children attending Edgewood schools‚Äîclaimed that the Texas school funding methods, which are determined by property taxes, were responsible for Edgewood‚Äôs inferior quality as a district. Low property values doomed kids to bad schools, so Edgewood was powerless to change its circumstances.\nThe State of Texas responded by claiming it provided ‚Äúa minimum‚Äù education, which was all they were legally required to do. In the oral arguments, Gochman pressed the court to consider what was at stake if the court ruled in favor of ‚Äúminimums‚Äù and against the Edgewood families.\nAmerica, he said, risked endorsing a dual-class society where some have access to real opportunity and others do not.\nGochman argued passionately on behalf of poor children living in the most resource-deprived school districts of San Antonio. According to news reports of the trial, a victory for Rodriguez and the Edgewood families seemed almost inevitable to those monitoring it closely. Governors and other state legislators braced for what Justice Lewis Powell later said would have been ‚Äúan unprecedented upheaval in public education.‚Äù As the New York Times reported at the time: ‚ÄúEvery state has studies under way, and many have passed or are considering legislation to eliminate‚Äù the fundamental inequalities in the U.S. system of school finance.\nBut the disruption never came. On March 21, 1973, the court ruled against Demetrio Rodriguez and the other Mexican American families from Edgewood. Education, they found, is not explicitly enumerated in the constitution as a right, so it could not be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nYet, even as it denied equality in education, the court said it highly valued education. In the majority opinion written by Justice Powell, the court reaffirmed its contention from Brown v. Board of Education that ‚Äúeducation is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.‚Äù The court even described the unjust character of America‚Äôs education system. It never reasoned that the way the U.S. funds education was fair or sensible.\nAs Justice Potter Stewart wrote, ‚ÄúThe method of financing public schools in Texas, as in almost every other State, has resulted in a system of public education that can fairly be described as chaotic and unjust. It does not follow, however, and I cannot find, that this system violates the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù\nThe American education system was not fair. It was merely constitutional.\nSince 1973, we have tried to fix education in many ways. We have tried fixing standards, teachers, school leaders, students, parents, tests, and everything in between. Two fixes we‚Äôve never called for: Amending the constitution to protect the right to an education, and transforming school finance systems that courts since Rodriguez have continued to condemn. To this day, in case after case, courts call our education finance system ‚Äúunjust,‚Äù ‚ÄúByzantine,‚Äù and ‚Äúawful‚Äù ‚Äî but not unconstitutional.\nI‚Äôve spent the last few months exploring the legacy of the Rodriguez case. It‚Äôs a famous case within education circles, but has not received anything near the attention of, say, Roe v. Wade. Even most people from San Antonio have likely never heard of it, just like me until a few years back. But as I‚Äôve learned, both the history and after-effects of Rodriguez are extremely illuminating. The story of Rodriguez has a lot to teach us. Each of those events or conversations provides insight into the present vulnerabilities felt across Texas and San Antonio.\nIn the weeks ahead, I‚Äôll be writing a series of essays about the Texas school finance system. It‚Äôs complicated stuff, but this issue is essential because of how it directly impacts so many people across Texas. My aim is to make the issue accessible ‚Äî and to show how this ‚Äúchaotic and unjust‚Äù system shapes the deep inequalities of possibility that threaten countless families and children today.\nNote: Photos of Demetrio Rodriguez are provided by Gil Barrera / Courtesy UTSA Special Collections"

Read the first and second essays.\nBy 1960, residential and public housing segregation had effectively consolidated San Antonio‚Äôs Hispanic residents on the West Side, where more than half lived in 18 of the city‚Äôs 92 census tracts. In nine of those tracts, nearly half of the housing was categorized by the federal government as ‚Äúdeteriorating‚Äù or ‚Äúdilapidated,‚Äù the latter of which was deemed hazardous to occupants‚Äô health and safety.\nWith unemployment rates nearly double the city‚Äôs, and with almost half of its residents without stable employment, West Side median incomes ranged from 29 to 60 percent of white incomes. Many industries limited the type of jobs black and Hispanic workers could do. As a result, nearly half the population on the West Side lived below the federal poverty line, which left a quarter of residents chronically hungry.\nInterviews from a 1968 United States Commission on Civil Rights investigation reveal widespread discrimination against Hispanic people in San Antonio. Parents and students expressed frustration as they saw another generation of bright and capable children denied the opportunity to thrive. One student at Lanier High School described college as ‚Äúan impossible dream.‚Äù\nLanier High School in San Antonio ISD would struggle with internal inequality within its district, but neighboring Edgewood ISD had been thoroughly isolated.\nEdgewood became the poster child for what writer Jonathan Kozol would call ‚ÄúSavage Inequalities‚Äù in his 1991 book of the same name. It was not only the poorest district in Texas at the time, but the poorest district in America‚Äôs 16 largest cities.\nWhat is most troubling is that 70 years prior, some in Texas had predicted exactly this."

    "text": "This is the fourth and final installment in a series of essays on the legacy of Rodriguez v. San Antonio ISD ‚Äî a court battle that began in San Antonio and ended in the Supreme Court ‚Äî and determined that American children have no constitutional right to an education. Read the first, second and third essays.\nIn 1968, Bexar County Commissioner A.J. Plough sat down with CBS News to discuss the plight of Latinos living in hunger and poverty on San Antonio‚Äôs West Side.\nPlough: ‚ÄúWell, why are they not getting enough food? Because the father won‚Äôt work. And I mean, won‚Äôt work. If they won‚Äôt work, do you expect the taxpayer to raise all the kids ‚Ä¶ ‚Äôcause their daddies won‚Äôt work? First, let‚Äôs do something with the daddies and then, yes, take care of the kids.\nThe reporter asked how chronically hungry students could be expected to learn on an empty stomach.\n‚ÄúWell, what do you mean learn properly in school? Do you really need school‚Ä¶ other than, say, an eighth grade education?‚Äù Plough said, later adding, ‚ÄúPeople keep talking about this education, ‚Äòa college education.‚Äô It‚Äôs not necessary.‚Äù\nMeanwhile, the same disparities that prompted the CBS interview caught the attention of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, which held hearings that same year in San Antonio to collect information regarding civil rights violations against Mexican-American families in the Southwest. What they found reveals how racism shaped society in the 20th century here and across the United States.\nIn total, the commission spent six months in San Antonio and interviewed more than 1,000 residents to understand these challenges in the context of housing, education, employment, voting and justice.\nContrary to the analysis of Plough and others, the Commission found that Hispanic parents desperately wanted good jobs, their children wanted to earn college degrees, and both wanted to eat three meals a day in decent housing. However, the education system and public infrastructure failed them. Parents faced discrimination in the workplace. Their upward mobility was further restricted by exclusionary real estate and lending practices. Using racially restrictive housing covenants white residents prohibited Black and Hispanic families from purchasing homes in multiple neighborhoods across the city. Such was unvarnished racism in mid-century America. Discrimination was not problematic, and equity was not a priority.\nAs a result of these attitudes, economic development, which increased property values and neighborhood resources, was unevenly distributed. Until 1977, San Antonio‚Äôs City Council was entirely made up of members who could live anywhere in the city, and the Northside was most heavily represented. Major investments like the South Texas Medical Center and the University of Texas at San Antonio directed the city‚Äôs continued growth to the north. Meanwhile, the parts of town where black and Hispanic families were contained ‚Äî the East, West and South Sides ‚Äî were further devalued by neglect of aging and absent infrastructure.\nPolitical, economic and social exclusion worked in concert to create an intractable disadvantage that still clings to the heels of ambitious and bright Hispanic students decades later. While few in 2017 would espouse overt racism, the damning testimony recorded by the Civil Rights commission has yet to be fully rectified."

    "section": "Transcript of My Testimony",
    "text": "Transcript of My Testimony\nMy name is Matt Worthington and I am a resident of Austin, TX; parent of two girls; former special education teacher; and a former district technology administrator of DC Public Schools and KIPP Austin Public Schools who holds a Masters in Education and am nearing completion of a second Master‚Äôs in Public Affairs from the LBJ School at the University of Texas.\nMembers of the committee: Texas schools are getting poorer faster than they‚Äôre getting bigger. Between 1995 & 2016, the share of students identified as economically disadvantaged in traditional ISDs rose by almost 13%1. In raw numbers, that translates to an 83% increase in the total number of economically disadvantaged students from 1995 to 2016. This is because the increase of poor students is outpacing the overall population growth of students.2\nThe current body of medical & economic research on child poverty tells us that poverty exposes children to what is called ‚Äútoxic stress‚Äù. This adversity has strong linear relationships with multiple health impairments in adulthood, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, alcoholism, and depression.3 They reduce life expectancies for children. Counter that, one of the more significant explanations for long life-expectancies is local government spending.4\nIn Texas, school poverty disproportionately effects students of color. In 2014, almost half of the non-white student population in Texas attended high-poverty schools, which generally have greater academic, social, and emotional needs but receive inadequate funding for programming.5\nMeanwhile, the state has lowered its share of per-pupil funding on traditional ISDs. Since 2008, the state‚Äôs funding has dipped by almost $500 per ADA while local property tax funding has skyrocketed at over $800 per ADA. Multiplied by the respective ADA counts of students in 2016, this shift constitutes an increased burden of roughly $4.3 billion for statewide local property tax funding and a decreased responsibility of roughly $2.5 billion for funding from the state.6\nData: Texas Education Agency - PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports; accessed via a public information request. \nWhile recapture was designed to provide equity, it has been undermined by the state‚Äôs supplanting of revenues that it claims to supplement. Detailed records of recapture revenues show an over 800% increase in annual collections since 1994, but the state maintains no accounting method that tracks exactly7 where recapture money goes, by district. In other words, the public cannot see where the money ends up.\nIncreasingly, poor districts are running out of ways to get more revenue. Nearly 43% of property poor districts have maxed out on their M&O rates compared to only 14% of property wealthy districts.8 This means poor districts are increasingly reliant on the hope for more funding from recapture. However, this hope is fragile because most property wealthy districts tax on M&O within their range of golden pennies, which is not subject to recapture.9 This is because many property wealthy districts do not trust the state as a fiduciary of recapture revenues.\nIf we fail to ensure that all 5.3 million children in Texas attend schools that are adequately and transparently funded, we risk a future where Texas is characterized by its lack moral, economic, or cultural wealth. That will happen if we fail to ensure that money intended for poor children actually makes its way to those classrooms where they are learning against all odds. If that means we, as Texas taxpayers, must pay more money than so be it. The lives of 5.3 million children and future generations of Texans literally depend upon it.\nThank you."

    "text": "Approaching the six-month mark of COVID-19 in Texas, one of the more common topics of discussion I hear is what the effects of coronavirus on our communities reveals about the world that existed before. And where we knew little about COVID-19 back in March, since that time a lot has been documented about what increases the risk of not only becoming severely ill, but also what increases the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 before you even get sick‚Äîsuch as having a job that requires you to be physically present for work (as opposed to working remotely from home) or not having access to a reliable internet connection.\nThat said, I want to explore some of these things in a series of blog posts‚Äìto see who is not only getting COVID, but also where folks are most at risk of being exposed to COVID and where they‚Äôre most at risk of not bouncing back. The trouble in answering these questions is that getting good data is difficult and, once you have it, organizing the data in a way that is useful and meaningful for others is even harder. So, I‚Äôm going to pace myself and search for datasets that can inform our conversation. For the purposes of these blog posts, I‚Äôm just going to focus on looking at the city-wide data in Austin‚Äîwhere I live‚Äîbecause I know all the data exists with regards to the questions I have pulled together. If you have questions, I invite you to ask them as well and I‚Äôll do my best to find data that can help provided some meaningful insight."

    "text": "Who is getting COVID-19 in Austin?\nBefore we do any exploration of the more complicated questions identified, the best starting point would be exploring where COVID is occuring most in Austin. So let‚Äôs look at that before digging into other questions and start by pulling Austin Public Health‚Äôs data‚Äîwhich organizes cases at the zip code level and updated frequently‚Äîto map out cases. We don‚Äôt have access to where deaths occur most often, but cases at the zip code level is more than you can find in a lot of places. So we‚Äôll use what we have.\nHere‚Äôs where cases are occurring most often right now:\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that cases are largely consolidated east of I-35. Without additional context, it‚Äôs worth wondering what role an interstate plays in shielding folks on one side from Coronavirus. With additional context about how the city was intentionally segregated through a ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù developed in 1928 that used I-35 as a form of physical division, it‚Äôs worth paying attention to the dynamics of I-35 and including it as a geographical marker throughout future analyses.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, I would highly recommend reading through this analysis by the Austin Statesman on the role of I-35 in the city‚Äôs history of racial segregation, as a starting point. Other histories have been documented elsewhere, but this is a good starting point.\n\nIn the next few blog posts, I‚Äôll be writing about risk + resilience. Originally, I wanted to include everything here, but the charts and analysis became pretty extensive. For fear of exhausting everyone, including myself. We‚Äôll take these questions piece by piece.\nNext Blogpost: Who should be most worried about getting COVID?\nNote about this series: If you‚Äôre interested in asking specific questions to explore in this, reach out to me via Facebook or Twitter and I‚Äôll do my best to find data that can help provide some kind of meaningful answer.\nWhere can I find the code for this blog? Once I clean up the mess in this repo, I‚Äôll make it public on github. For now, I‚Äôm happy to share individual the Rmarkdown file used to produce each article.\n\n\nTLDR | Why not do this at the statewide level?\n\nOriginally, I considered focusing these articles at the statewide level for Texas, but I kept running into issues around finding data that could meaningfully answer some of my questions. The reasons for this are many, but some of the state‚Äôs existing COVID-19 data cannot be aggregated at anything beyond the statewide level for reasons outside of their control.\n\nExample - Test Positivity\nFor example, county-level test positivity is one of those things that has been difficult because COVID-19 lab testing has largely been decentralized, with over 97% of tests being conducted in commercial labs. Consequently, this means the state has to then coordinate data from over 4 million tests conducted outside of state testing labs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Number of People Tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Texas, By Lab Type\n    \n    \n      Source: Texas Department of State Health Services | As of August 10th at 3:00PM CST1\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Location\n      Tests Processed\n    \n  \n  \n    \nTotal People Tested in Texas by Public Health Lab\n122.02K\n    \nNo. Tests by Commercial labs*\n4.49M\n    Total Tests\n‚Äî\n4,611,777\n  \n  \n    \n      *Unable to deduplicate figures for Commercial labs.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Data: From the 'Accessible Dashboard Data' File, under the 'Tests' tab.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAnd given that these commercial labs aren‚Äôt actually part of a state agency, this means they have to learn new reporting rhythms and do work that, perhaps, they didn‚Äôt plan for or know they needed to do‚Äìsuch as keep all of the positives and negatives for each county, record those in a database by the county of origin, deduplicate them by the person who got the test, and then share all of that information back to the state in a manner that is uniform with all the other private labs in the state.\nThat said, not being able to compare how much a county is testing with how much they‚Äôre testing positive weakens a potential analysis and limits how much you can explore the dynamics between risk factors and things like test positivity.\n\n\nExample - Demographic Data\nAnother example of this information is demographic data about cases and fatalities. That information also doesn‚Äôt exist broken down by county‚Äìsometimes due to HIPAA requirements.\nSo if you wanted to analyze geographic COVID-19 trends between counties across multiple pieces of data such as demographic, known risk-factors, and other trends, you‚Äôd have a hard time accomplishing that because it currently doesn‚Äôt exist.\nFor that reason, I‚Äôve chosen to just focus on using city-level data given that cities tend to have better access to local information about their communities."
