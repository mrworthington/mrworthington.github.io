And where we knew little about COVID-19 back in March, since that time a lot has been documented about what increases the risk of not only becoming severely ill, but also what increases the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 before you even get sick—such as having a job that requires you to be physically present for work (as opposed to working remotely from home) or not having access to a reliable internet connection.\nThat said, I want to explore some of these things in a series of blog posts–to see who is not only getting COVID, but also where folks are most at risk of being exposed to COVID and where they’re most at risk of not bouncing back. The trouble in answering these questions is that getting good data is difficult and, once you have it, organizing the data in a way that is useful and meaningful for others is even harder. So, I’m going to pace myself and search for datasets that can inform our conversation. For the purposes of these blog posts, I’m just going to focus on looking at the city-wide data in Austin—where I live—because I know all the data exists with regards to the questions I have pulled together. If you have questions, I invite you to ask them as well and I’ll do my best to find data that can help provided some meaningful insight.\n\nThe Texas Tribune had a good write-up on the caveats of state-wide data that I’ would recommend reading on this topic.\nWho is getting COVID-19 in Austin?\nBefore we do any exploration of the more complicated questions identified, the best starting point would be exploring where COVID is occuring most in Austin. So let’s look at that before digging into other questions and start by pulling Austin Public Health’s data—which organizes cases at the zip code level and updated frequently—to map out cases. We don’t have access to where deaths occur most often, but cases at the zip code level is more than you can find in a lot of places. So we’ll use what we have.\nHere’s where cases are occuring most often right now:\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that cases are largely consolidated east of I-35. Without additional context, it’s worth wondering what role an interstate plays in shielding folks on one side from Coronavirus. With additional context about how the city was intentionally segregated through a “master plan” developed in 1928 that used I-35 as a form of physical division, it’s worth paying attention to the dynamics of I-35 and including it as a geographical marker throughout future analyses.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, I would highly recommend reading through this analysis by the Austin Statesman on the role of I-35 in the city’s history of racial segregation, as a starting point. Other histories have been documented elsewhere, but this is a good starting point.\nIn the next few blog posts, I’ll be writing about risk + resilience. Originally, I wanted to include everything here, but the charts and analysis became pretty extensive. For fear of exhausting everyone, including myself. We’ll take these questions piece by piece.\nNext Blogpost: Who should be most worried about getting COVID?\nNote about this series: If you’re interested in asking specific questions to explore in this, reach out to me via Facebook or Twitter and I’ll do my best to find data that can help provide some kind of meaningful answer.\nWhere can I find the code for this blog? Once I clean up the mess in this repo, I’ll make it public on github. For now, I’m happy to share individual the Rmarkdown file used to produce each article.\nTLDR | Why not do this at the statewide level? Originally, I considered focusing these articles at the statewide level for Texas, but I kept running into issues around finding data that could meaningfully answer some of my questions. The reasons for this are many, but some of the state’s existing COVID-19 data cannot be aggregated at anything beyond the statewide level for reasons outside of their control.\nExample - Test Positivity\nFor example, county-level test positivity is one of those things that has been difficult because COVID-19 lab testing has largely been decentralized, with over 97% of tests being conducted in commercial labs. Consequently, this means the state has to then coordinate data from over 4 million tests conducted outside of state testing labs.\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe

Type\n    Source: Texas Department of State Health Services | As of August 10th at 3:00PM CST1\n    \n      Location\n      Tests Processed\n    \n      Total People Tested in Texas by Public Health Lab\n      122.02K\n    \n      No. Tests by Commercial labs*\n      4.49M\n    Total Tests\n      —\n      4,611,777\n    *Unable to deduplicate figures for Commercial labs.\n    \n        \n          1\n          Data: From the 'Accessible Dashboard Data' File, under the 'Tests' tab.\n          \n      \n    \n\nAnd given that these commercial labs aren’t actually part of a state agency, this means they have to learn new reporting rhythms and do work that, perhaps, they didn’t plan for or know they needed to do–such as keep all of the positives and negatives for each county, record those in a database by the county of origin, deduplicate them by the person who got the test, and then share all of that information back to the state in a manner that is uniform with all the other private labs in the state.\nThat said, not being able to compare how much a county is testing with how much they’re testing positive weakens a potential analysis and limits how much you can explore the dynamics between risk factors and things like test positivity.\nExample - Demographic Data\nAnother example of this information is demographic data about cases and fatalities. That information also doesn’t exist broken down by county–sometimes due to HIPAA requirements.\nSo if you wanted to analyze geographic COVID-19 trends between counties across multiple pieces of data such as demographic, known risk-factors, and other trends, you’d have a hard time accomplishing that because it currently doesn’t exist.\nFor that reason, I’ve chosen to just focus on using city-level data given that cities tend to have better access to local information about their communities.\nPhoto Credit\nPhoto by Ryan Magsino on Unsplash\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThis evening, the Ed Trust is hosting a discussion on twitter at 8PM ET on school funding inequity, so I thought I would do a code-through of a visualization I made this past summer while researching the legacy of a famous school finance Supreme Court case that ended up determining that Americans had no fundamental right to an education. In short, it shows the shares of funding over time for each of the three main sources of funding for public education in America: federal funding, state funding, and local funding (mostly property taxes).\nWhy Visualize School Finance?\nIn recent years, much has been debated about school funding, or the lack thereof. Notably, recent studies coming out of places like Texas A&M and the US Commission on Civil Rights have highlighted funding deficits throughout America that not only threaten the futures of currently enrolled public school students, but our future economies throughout America.\nYou may not have children, but school finance impacts you regardless. And as one news executive said recently in a visit to one of my public policy classes, “school finance is the thing people should be talking about but will likely never get talked about.”\nSo here’s to helping people understand with clean visualizations. Alright, let’s see the map and get to the code-through.\nThe Map\n\n\n\nThe Code Through\nWhile we’ll visualize the three sources of funding, this dataset will organize a few other data points of use. While I’ll do my best to address what each one is, I may overlook a few variables. If I do, you can reach out to me or reach out to the folks at the Census’ Educational Finance Branch.\nAccessing All the Data Used Here\nFor this code-through, you can download all the data used for this code-through from my github, which includes the inflation & state “FIPS” code data needed for the visualization to work properly. Just add it to whatever directory you’re working out of and you’ll be good to go.\nImport School Finance Data\nWhile you already have the data, the US Census has been collecting data from every school district in the country since the 1960s. Using their FTP database, you can download the files here and other various datasets related to public finance. For our purposes, we’ll use their elementary and secondary school finance survey files and start from 1993 for a couple of reasons explained by clicking on the tooltips here1 2.\nTo access this raw data, you can go to the US Census FTP database where the school finance datasets are stored and download them into a folder there. First, go to the FTP database. Second, choose “Allow” when prompted and select guest when asked for authentication.\nOnce you do this, you should see a dialogue showing your connection status that looks like this.\nAfter the data downloads into the remote disk, find the files with the following labels highlighted in purple below (i.e., \"elsec.93.xls\") and download them into a folder called “data”. Once you do that, save a .Rproj file into the same location and you’ll be able to run the code below without much trouble (I hope).\nOne note about my code. By no means am I an expert in R and when I produced this code, I knew way less about the tidyverse than I do now. If any other R folks have feedback, I’m 100% open to ways I can make this code cleaner and more efficient.\n\n\nsetwd(\"data/\")\n\n#Import Census School Finance Data\nsf1993 <-

One note about this one is that it uses the All-Consumer series inflation index from the Bureau of Labor & Statistics for 1992, while the 1993 data onward uses the BLS Education Index.\n\n\n\nCorrections\nIf you see mistakes or want to suggest changes, please create an issue on the source repository.\nBefore 1992, the method of collection for the census didn’t disaggregate federal revenues from state revenues because federal dollars were technically implemented through the state. However, since 1992, the census shifted their reporting protocols for states and began requesting that each state delineate between their contributions versus what the federal government provided.↩︎\nWhile this method of collection started in 1992, our analysis will start in 1993 because that is when the Bureau of Labor & Statistics introduced their Education Inflation Index, which was meant to provide clarity on a dollar’s value in the education space.↩︎\n",

Between 1995 & 2016, the share of students identified as economically disadvantaged in traditional ISDs rose by almost 13%1. In raw numbers, that translates to an 83% increase in the total number of economically disadvantaged students from 1995 to 2016. This is because the increase of poor students is outpacing the overall population growth of students.2\nThe current body of medical & economic research on child poverty tells us that poverty exposes children to what is called “toxic stress”. This adversity has strong linear relationships with multiple health impairments in adulthood, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, alcoholism, and depression.3 They reduce life expectancies for children. Counter that, one of the more significant explanations for long life-expectancies is local government spending.4\nIn Texas, school poverty disproportionately effects students of color. In 2014, almost half of the non-white student population in Texas attended high-poverty schools, which generally have greater academic, social, and emotional needs but receive inadequate funding for programming.5\nMeanwhile, the state has lowered its share of per-pupil funding on traditional ISDs. Since 2008, the state’s funding has dipped by almost $500 per ADA while local property tax funding has skyrocketed at over $800 per ADA. Multiplied by the respective ADA counts of students in 2016, this shift constitutes an increased burden of roughly $4.3 billion for statewide local property tax funding and a decreased responsibility of roughly $2.5 billion for funding from the state.6\nData: Texas Education Agency - PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports; accessed via a public information request. \nWhile recapture was designed to provide equity, it has been undermined by the state’s supplanting of revenues that it claims to supplement. Detailed records of recapture revenues show an over 800% increase in annual collections since 1994, but the state maintains no accounting method that tracks exactly7 where recapture money goes, by district. In other words, the public cannot see where the money ends up.\nIncreasingly, poor districts are running out of ways to get more revenue. Nearly 43% of property poor districts have maxed out on their M&O rates compared to only 14% of property wealthy districts.8 This means poor districts are increasingly reliant on the hope for more funding from recapture. However, this hope is fragile because most property wealthy districts tax on M&O within their range of golden pennies, which is not subject to recapture.9 This is because many property wealthy districts do not trust the state as a fiduciary of recapture revenues.\nIf we fail to ensure that all 5.3 million children in Texas attend schools that are adequately and transparently funded, we risk a future where Texas is characterized by its lack moral, economic, or cultural wealth. That will happen if we fail to ensure that money intended for poor children actually makes its way to those classrooms where they are learning against all odds. If that means we, as Texas taxpayers, must pay more money than so be it. The lives of 5.3 million children and future generations of Texans literally depend upon it.\nThank you.\nPhoto Credit\nPhoto by Meggyn Pomerleau on Unsplash\n\nData: Texas Education Agency - Annual Snapshot School District Profiles, 1995 & 2016.↩︎\nI use the phrase “poor children” or “in poverty” here in reference to students who are economically disadvantaged. While some are quick to note that the Federal Poverty Guidelines are not the same thing as economically disadvantaged (which follows guidelines from the National School Lunch & Breakfast Programs), it’s worth noting that the Federal Poverty Guideline is often criticized for being a very low measure of poverty in 2018. For a family of four, the 2018 Federal Poverty Guideline is $25,100. This figure is before taxes, which would further reduce the take home pay. The numbers used to determine economically disadvantaged are either 130% (the free-lunch population) or 180% (the reduced-lunch population) of the Federal Poverty Guideline, which are far lower than the 200% measure used by many poverty research institutions like Spotlight on Poverty & Opportunity: The Source for News, Ideas and Action.↩︎\nShonkoff, J.

    "contents": "\nThis is the fourth and final installment in a series of essays on the legacy of Rodriguez v. San Antonio ISD — a court battle that began in San Antonio and ended in the Supreme Court — and determined that American children have no constitutional right to an education. Read the first, second and third essays.\nIn 1968, Bexar County Commissioner A.J. Plough sat down with CBS News to discuss the plight of Latinos living in hunger and poverty on San Antonio’s West Side.\nPlough: \"Well, why are they not getting enough food? Because the father won’t work. And I mean, won’t work. If they won’t work, do you expect the taxpayer to raise all the kids … ’cause their daddies won’t work? First, let’s do something with the daddies and then, yes, take care of the kids.\n\n\nClip: AJ Plough Interview from 1968 CBS Documentary “Hunger in America”\nThe reporter asked how chronically hungry students could be expected to learn on an empty stomach.\n“Well, what do you mean learn properly in school? Do you really need school… other than, say, an eighth grade education?” Plough said, later adding, “People keep talking about this education, ‘a college education.’ It’s not necessary.”\nMeanwhile, the same disparities that prompted the CBS interview caught the attention of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, which held hearings that same year in San Antonio to collect information regarding civil rights violations against Mexican-American families in the Southwest. What they found reveals how racism shaped society in the 20th century here and across the United States.\nIn total, the commission spent six months in San Antonio and interviewed more than 1,000 residents to understand these challenges in the context of housing, education, employment, voting and justice.\nContrary to the analysis of Plough and others, the Commission found that Hispanic parents desperately wanted good jobs, their children wanted to earn college degrees, and both wanted to eat three meals a day in decent housing. However, the education system and public infrastructure failed them. Parents faced discrimination in the workplace. Their upward mobility was further restricted by exclusionary real estate and lending practices. Using racially restrictive housing covenants white residents prohibited Black and Hispanic families from purchasing homes in multiple neighborhoods across the city. Such was unvarnished racism in mid-century America. Discrimination was not problematic, and equity was not a priority.\nAs a result of these attitudes, economic development, which increased property values and neighborhood resources, was unevenly distributed. Until 1977, San Antonio’s City Council was entirely made up of members who could live anywhere in the city, and the Northside was most heavily represented. Major investments like the South Texas Medical Center and the University of Texas at San Antonio directed the city’s continued growth to the north. Meanwhile, the parts of town where black and Hispanic families were contained — the East, West and South Sides — were further devalued by neglect of aging and absent infrastructure.\nPolitical, economic and social exclusion worked in concert to create an intractable disadvantage that still clings to the heels of ambitious and bright Hispanic students decades later. While few in 2017 would espouse overt racism, the damning testimony recorded by the Civil Rights commission has yet to be fully rectified.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from Folo Media. The Thiry Fine Arts Building at Our Lady of the Lake University was the site of the 1968 hearings of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Tomas Gonzalez / Special to Folo Media\n\n\n\nEres sucio\nAt around 7 p.m. on Dec. 10, 1968, five students reported to Our Lady of the Lake’s Thiry Auditorium to give their testimonies before the United States Commission on Civil Rights.\nThe students were from Lanier High School in San Antonio ISD and Edgewood High School in Edgewood ISD. Both schools had disproportionately large Mexican-American populations — the result of housing segregation in the city over the past century. Exclusive neighborhoods began to crop up around downtown beginning in the late 19th century, with “suburbs” like Dignowity Hill and districts like King William. In the 1930s as the city expanded, exclusivity was codified by restrictive neighborhood covenants and discriminatory lending practices by the Federal Housing Administration.\nIn the heavily Hispanic areas of town, schools reflected this segregation. The teachers and administration in these schools, the students said, had taken it upon themselves to rid them of their “dirty” culture.\nWhen they spoke to the Commission, each student recounted instances of corporal punishment administered by teachers or administrators for speaking Spanish. Though family, friends and classmates served in the military, paid taxes and contributed to the community in other ways, students had been told their culture was dirty and that their ancestors contributed nothing to America. Routinely, staff explained they needed to be better Americans.\nFrom Edgar Lozano, who was a junior at Lanier:\n“If they caught you talking Spanish, they would send you to the office and give you a warning. They would give you a long lecture about, if you wanted to be an American, you have got to speak English. And you were not a very good American, and all that, and Spanish isn’t your language, you know; that is in Mexico. So you are an American. You speak English.”\nMany students wanted better jobs than their parents — who had been limited to low-wage work — but students were repeatedly told to focus on vocational courses like wood-working or homemaking. If they had no interest in vocational work, they were provided opportunities to meet with military recruiters.\nCollege was a world away as far as they were concerned. If they asked about it, school counselors reminded them they wouldn’t finish high school. Unlike schools in the northern part of the city, career days at Edgewood or Lanier did not include doctors and lawyers. Instead, convicted criminals were brought in as guest speakers to give motivational speeches discouraging them from lives of crime.\nIn the days before government subsidized free or reduced-rate lunches, most students endured their mistreatment on an empty stomach.\nShortly after Lozano started elementary school on San Antonio’s West Side in the 1950s, he wanted to get his teacher’s attention one morning but didn’t know how. Born in Mexico and brought to the city as a child, Lozano only spoke Spanish. The school had no classes or lessons for students trying to learn English.\n“I called her ‘Ma’am,’” Lozano told the commission, “because I heard somebody else say ‘Ma’am,’ and she turned around and she gave me a belt right in the mouth. I mean, she knocked me down.”\n“Stupid, the word is Madame,” she told him.\nLater, a teacher overhead Lozano studying for his Spanish class. She assumed he was speaking Spanish socially, and reported him to the administration. Speaking to the commission, Lozano recounted what happened in the administrator’s office:\n\"I told them what had happened, and he said: ‘Now, don’t give me that.’\nAnd I said: ‘Well, you know, I don’t want to be hit anymore.’\nAnd he said: ‘No, no, no, no, we are going to fix you up right. You are going to learn English.’ So he hit me again.\"\nLozano estimated to the panel that the administrator had hit him at least five times that school year — every time for speaking Spanish.\n“How would you like for somebody to come up to you and tell you what you speak is a dirty language?” Lozano asked the panel.\nHistory class\nHistory class was the other tool teachers used to rid students of their Mexican identity. Highlighting white heroes in Texas and U.S. history, schools neglected to mention Mexican-American contributions to Texas or American history.\nExcluded were basic facts, like the long history of Spanish Texas or that three signers of the state’s Declaration of Independence had been Mexican (one of whom served as its first Vice President).\nDespite watching countless family and friends leave for war and never come home, students at Lanier and Edgewood (as well as other Texas schools) also never heard of Mexican-Americans who contributed to America during World War II, the Korean War or Vietnam. By 1968, more than a dozen of the state’s Hispanic soldiers received Congressional Medals of Honor.\nCollectively, the denigration of their language, history and culture left students void of identity.\nIn his testimony before the Civil Rights commission, Lozano lamented: “… in my 12 years in school I have never learned what I am. My history, I don’t know that. I don’t exactly know what to call myself.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure from Folo Media. In 1968, students from Lanier High School were among those interviewed by the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Tomas Gonzalez / Special to Folo Media\n\n\n\nResistance\nIn April and May 1968, the students at Lanier and Edgewood organized mass walkouts. At Lanier, roughly 700 students and community members protested. At Edgewood, 400 students walked out after the 10 a.m. bell. The students presented their administrations with a list of grievances and demanded better course offerings and college counseling, which at Edgewood was limited to a select few. Staff offered help with grants and admissions applications, but only for those they deemed likely to succeed. Discreetly, staff would pull individual students out of class and direct them to the cafeteria for information sessions.\nDiana Herrera was not selected.\nAfter learning that counsellors were intentionally keeping this program quiet, she marched to the front office in protest.\n“I demanded to know why my name was not on the list, because I was going to go,” Herrera told Folo Media in August. College was part of her plan, but the Edgewood counsellors didn’t see it that way.\n“The counseling department immediately interrupted me, said I was not going to college, and that I would — and I remember the words: ‘You’re going to marry Richard and have children.’”\nHerrera went on to become an educator in Edgewood for many years; she now works in the community on behalf of Edgewood with groups like the Intercultural Development Research Association.\n\n\nWhat (hasn’t) changed\nIn 2017, some might like to think the days described by Lozano and Herrera are far behind — that characters like Plough are contained in the pages of folk history of “back when we were racist.”\nWhile many of the overt offenses are gone and explicitly racist language is less socially acceptable, the structural inequities remain. A new generation has taken up the causes of the Civil Rights era in attempts to complete what was begun half a century ago.\nStudents are no longer beaten for speaking Spanish. In fact, dual-language programs have become a premium service, most commonly available in well-funded districts. Ironically, while students who speak Spanish at home might thrive in a dual-language program, they often do not get the chance. Like advanced placement and college preparatory courses, dual-language programs are more readily available in property wealthy districts, or in the wealthier schools within large districts. Over the past two years, SAISD has become a notable local exception to this disparity by opening 11 new dual language academies in majority-Hispanic neighborhoods.\nSouthside, Harlandale and Southwest ISDs have two-way bilingual programs which combine native speakers of Spanish and English to help both groups become bilingual.\nHistory curriculum has also seen uneven progress. Fine arts programs in San Antonio celebrate mariachi and muralist traditions, but traditional academic coursework is still in the hands of the state.\nIn 2014, the Texas State Board of Education put out a call for text books on Mexican-American studies. Even though the Texas Education Agency reports that 52.4 percent of Texas school children are Hispanic, the state still groups Mexican-American studies under “ethnic studies,” an elective available to high school students. It has resisted efforts to create a standalone Mexican-American studies course.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure from Folo Media.\n\n\n\nThe first submission for the contract, “Mexican-American Heritage,” was widely reviled by history scholars, Hispanic lawmakers and Latino activists. It implied that Mexican-Americans were non-committal toward the U.S. and that the Chicano movement of the Civil Rights era espoused a “revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society.”\nLast month, a second submission by activist Tony Diaz was rejected by the State Board of Education. While the board claimed the text did not meet curricular standards for social studies, critics have said the failure to find an appropriate text book marks a lack of commitment to Mexican-American studies as a whole.\nIt should be noted that Houston ISD recently adopted its own Mexican-American history curriculum, which scholars say is far more accurate and respectful than any effort by the state so far.\nThe testimonies from the 1968 Civil Rights commission echo in other challenges currently faced by Hispanic students.\nIn April 2016, a group of community activists, rallied by San Antonio City Councilman Rey Saldaña, gathered to address ongoing frustration with South San ISD.\nIvy League universities and other competitive schools are now focusing on recruiting Hispanic scholars. Saldaña himself is an alum of 98 percent-Hispanic South San High School and went on to Stanford University for his bachelor’s and master’s degrees.\nNonetheless, South San High School 2016 valedictorian Araceli Garcia told the South San activists that a teacher at her high school had advised her not to bother applying to out of state schools, and chastised her for applying to the University of Southern California, saying that it would be too expensive for her parents. Garcia did not identify the teacher, and said that she was not the only member of her class to be dissuaded from such ambitions.\nGarcia went on to list other inadequacies — in particular, classes without textbooks, teachers who would not help students apply for scholarships — at South San, which, in 2016, had recently come under sanction from the state.\nProperty values remain a critical piece of school finance, as Saldaña knows, and Hispanic-majority communities continue to lag behind areas with more diversity. Leaders like Saldaña have pursued economic development for the South, West and East Sides, but development on the Northside is decades ahead, benefiting from a virtuous cycle of investment.\n“People just believe it’s in the best interest of building a great city to keep the bad things out of sight of the nice areas,” Saldaña said, “and conversely the nice things need to continue to go in the nice areas, parks, highways to more growth, etc.”\nThe mixed progress toward equitable education for Hispanic students reflects the fundamental flaw at the heart of education in Texas: The system was built with a bias, from the curriculum down to the funding mechanisms. When Center for Public Policy Priorities analyst Chandra Villanueva describes the Texas school finance system, she uses the metaphor of an old house with a patchwork of repairs where full renovation is needed instead.\nWhile the Texas Supreme Court ruled in May 2016 that the school finance system was, in fact, constitutional, it did not give the funding mechanisms and legislation glowing reviews. In the court’s 100-page opinion, Justice Don Willett called the system “Byzantine.”\n“Shortfalls in both resources and performance persist in innumerable respects, and a perilously large number of students is in danger of falling further behind,” wrote Justice Eva Guzman in her concurring opinion.\nNeither the U.S. Supreme Court, nor the Texas Supreme Court, went so far as to connect the inadequacies and inequalities of the school finance system to the explicit racism experienced by Texas students.\nLikewise, Villanueva does not usually comment on the racial inequity laid into the foundation of the house. However, she told Folo that the excessively complicated formulas and half-hearted fixes are telltale signs of this deeper problem.\n“When you develop a school finance system that’s based on local property values at the exact same time that you’re explicitly segregating neighborhoods on race, then you can’t act surprised 50 years later — 70 years later — when things are unequal,” Villanueva said. “It was very intentional the way that we set up school districts and funding at a time when it was OK to be explicitly racist. And we are experiencing the fallout from that system.”\nAcknowledgments\nThis article was produced during my time at Folo Media during 2017.

    "contents": "\nThis is the third installment in a series of essays on the legacy of a court battle that began in San Antonio, ended in the Supreme Court, and determined that American children have no constitutional right to an education. Read the first and second essays.\nBy 1960, residential and public housing segregation had effectively consolidated San Antonio’s Hispanic residents on the West Side, where more than half lived in 18 of the city’s 92 census tracts. In nine of those tracts, nearly half of the housing was categorized by the federal government as “deteriorating” or “dilapidated,” the latter of which was deemed hazardous to occupants’ health and safety.\nWith unemployment rates nearly double the city’s, and with almost half of its residents without stable employment, West Side median incomes ranged from 29 to 60 percent of white incomes. Many industries limited the type of jobs black and Hispanic workers could do. As a result, nearly half the population on the West Side lived below the federal poverty line, which left a quarter of residents chronically hungry.\nInterviews from a 1968 United States Commission on Civil Rights investigation reveal widespread discrimination against Hispanic people in San Antonio. Parents and students expressed frustration as they saw another generation of bright and capable children denied the opportunity to thrive. One student at Lanier High School described college as “an impossible dream.”\nLanier High School in San Antonio ISD would struggle with internal inequality within its district, but neighboring Edgewood ISD had been thoroughly isolated.\nEdgewood became the poster child for what writer Jonathan Kozol would call “Savage Inequalities” in his 1991 book of the same name. It was not only the poorest district in Texas at the time, but the poorest district in America’s 16 largest cities.\nWhat is most troubling is that 70 years prior, some in Texas had predicted exactly this.\nThe district nobody wanted\nIn a 1921 report, the Texas Department of Education noticed that some of the state’s 7,000-plus school districts were too small and too poor to function alone. Without being absorbed by larger districts through consolidation, these districts would be unsustainable.\nIn response, State Superintendent of Public Instruction (a position replaced by the Education Commissioner in 1949) Annie Blanton recommended a statewide analysis of each district complete with strategic proposals for consolidation to ensure districts would have enough money.\nBlanton noted, however, that merging districts was easier said than done.\n“The principal obstacles to school consolidation are to be found in local prejudices, local jealousies, and in real estate considerations,” Blanton wrote. The primary reason Blanton gave for doubting the possibility of consolidation was that “certain wealthy property owners oppose these plans.” They did not want to see higher taxes, nor did they want to see others benefit from higher property values afforded by a strong school district. In short: They wanted to keep their “advantage.”\nThe best chance for consolidation came in 1947, when the State Legislature passed a massive overhaul of public education with the Gilmer-Aikin Act. Among its reforms was minimum funding measures designed to equalize resources and a call for consolidation of the state’s 4,500 districts.\nThe state had made consolidation recommendations to each county in the 1930s, but Gilmer-Aikin’s passing left the decision of consolidating up to local school districts who negotiated directly with one another.\n“They were looking so carefully at property values,” says Dr. Christine Drennon, director of Trinity University’s Urban Studies program. “These negotiations, when they made it to paper, were financial. They were about: How much property do you bring to this agreement? What’s your debt? How many kids you got? And is this a good financial agreement?”\nIt was a deal Edgewood could never close. The tiny, poor district wanted consolidation, but other districts were leery. Ranked near the bottom of Texas property values and per-pupil spending by a public report in 1972, newspapers also reported the district had debts totalling $500,000. If a district inherited Edgewood, it also meant inheriting its history of challenges.\nThose challenges included housing that had degraded into slum conditions, tuberculosis outbreaks, segregation, lacking infrastructure, few businesses, and thousands of children living in tax-exempt public housing. In a previous essay, Folo Media explored how those conditions came to be, and how the residents were trapped in Edgewood by exclusionary 20th century housing practices.\n“Nobody wanted Edgewood,” said Chandra Villanueva, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. “They became [an independent] district because nobody else would take them.”\nSome districts reached merger agreements — to become Northside, San Antonio and Northeast — and a few chose to remain exclusive, like Alamo Heights and Harlandale. Edgewood was left to fend for itself.\nTo Villanueva, the story that played out in Edgewood looks predictable. \"When you develop a school finance system that’s based on local property values at the exact same time that you’re explicitly segregating neighborhoods on race, then you can’t act surprised 50 years later — 70 years later — when things are unequal.\n“[It] was very intentional the way that we set up school districts and funding at a time when it was OK to be explicitly racist. And we are experiencing the fallout from that system.”\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from Folo Media. A 1968 Civil Rights Commission Report noted that with Kelly Air Force Base encompassing 1/4 of Edgewood ISD’s property and 13.5 percent of Edgewood students living in tax-exempt public housing, the district had significantly limited opportunity to generate money through property taxes. Note: Kelly AFB boundaries are only estimates.\n\n\n\nThe Kelly Paradox\nTechnically, Edgewood in the 1960s had substantial property wealth. Kelly Air Force Base — the city’s largest employer and military installation at that time — was right around the corner from where most Edgewood families lived.\nA 1969 analysis of the local economy showed that federal spending in the greater San Antonio area was just under $1.2 billion and was responsible for more than 34,000 jobs in the city.\nYet, despite thousands of jobs and stable sources of federal cash flowing through the Edgewood area, analysts and researchers sent to study San Antonio repeatedly cited Kelly AFB as a problem for a community that had more misery than it could bear.\nFor starters, Kelly AFB, while providing jobs for families, did not yield property taxes for the district. (Nor did the public housing that served 13 percent of Edgewood students.)\nAnother problem was employment inequity on the base itself. By December 1968, 126 formal complaints had been registered at Kelly and six studies were published analyzing patterns of racial discrimination documented between 1917-1966.\nOf the six reports, each concluded significant imbalances in higher-wage jobs among ethnic groups on base. While minorities accounted for over half the employees on base, whites maintained 85.4 percent of the 1,254 supervisor jobs and 90 percent of high-wage non-supervisor personnel despite having no quantifiable educational or supervisory advantage. An internal report of Kelly’s Equal Employment Opportunity subcommittee called these figures: “inequities of staggering magnitude.”\nEdgewood’s isolation emerged as the consequence of a cycle of segregation and exclusion. What could be summarized as an issue of “wealth,” clean data and hard numbers, was rooted in something far more human and racially motivated. In the next essay, Folo Media will take a deeper look at the findings of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission’s investigation into discrimination against Mexican-Americans in San Antonio and the American Southwest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis article was produced during my time at Folo Media during 2017.

    "contents": "\nNote: This story was originally published by Folo Media.\nThis is the second installment in a series of essays on the legacy of a court battle that began in San Antonio, ended in the Supreme Court, and determined that American children have no constitutional right to an education. Read the opening essay here.\nIn San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, Demetrio Rodriguez’s allegation of bias based on wealth was built on decades of injustice that neither began nor ended at the schoolhouse doors.\nHad the Supreme Court decided in Rodriguez’s favor, it might have raised questions about how property values came to be so unevenly distributed across San Antonio. The way communities built the “wealth” that gave them such an advantage in the Texas school finance formula was the result of some of San Antonio’s most deadly public policy decisions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from Folo Media. In this 1949 photo, children play near outdoor toilets in “slum-corrals” on San Antonio’s West Side. In these particular shanties, built in 1913, six toilets and one shower were shared by more than 100 residents. COURTESY THE DOLPH BRISCOE CENTER FOR AMERICAN HISTORY / THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n\n\nHow to build a slum\nIn July 1945, residents of the newly-built Alazan and Apache courts received typewritten notices that read:\n“Do you want to be defeated by the enemy? Do you want this enemy to sneak up and stab you in the back? Do you want this enemy to seek out your little boy or little girl, your husband, wife, or your parents and overcome them?”\nThough the West Side, where Edgewood ISD is located, was home to America’s largest military training center at the start of World War II, this notice was not war propaganda. Instead, notes like these were part of an ongoing effort to combat a wide array of diseases that plagued San Antonio for much the 20th century.\nPolio, diarrhea and typhoid were among the most common threats, but none was more devastating or difficult to overcome than tuberculosis. From 1939-1941, San Antonio had the highest death rate from tuberculosis among the 92 largest cities in the United States. During each of those years in San Antonio, 151.7 residents out of every 100,000 died from tuberculosis. This was nearly triple the average of all 92 large American cities during that time.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure from Folo Media.\n\n\n\nThe deaths were not evenly spread across town. For every 100,000 people, the tuberculosis death rate for whites was 52 and for blacks was 152. For the Hispanic population, largely confined to the city’s West Side, the tuberculosis death rate was a staggering 302 per 100,000.\nThe West Side lacked critical health and sanitation infrastructure. Minutes from a 1923 city council meeting show that on two different occasions, West Side residents from the Edgewood area had requested to be recognized as an “improvement district” — which would have prioritized the area’s sewage, transportation and safety needs. Next to each request, the minutes simply read: “not granted.”\nMany of the public utilities that defined modern life were lacking in the “Edgewood Addition,” as the subdivision was called, making it susceptible to the kind of public health crisis that erupted in the 1945 outbreak. With no plumbing or water, communities often shared six toilets and a single shower among 100 neighbors. To care for themselves, resourceful community members would pool their money together for a day’s rent at a hotel room in downtown San Antonio. This allowed each person to take a hot bath.\nMany bought their drinking water from private vendors, or used private wells. These unregulated sources opened the community to increased risk of waterborne illness, despite precautions taken by residents.\n\nFrom 1939-1941, San Antonio had the highest death rate from tuberculosis among the 92 largest cities in the United States.\n\nRain presented another problem. The lack of drainage systems created what some parts of the West Side call “El Barrio De Charco” or “The Neighborhood of Puddles.” The standing water also heightened the risk of disease because it was perfect for breeding mosquito colonies.\nThe city leadership of the time was aware of these problems. Six years before the outbreak, in 1939, Mayor Maury Maverick had chastised the City Council for its neglect as it prepared to restore La Villita into at “arts village.” At a city celebration announcing “beautiful Villita,” Maverick co-opted the moment to address the causes of the city’s tuberculosis epidemic and its disproportionate impact on the city’s West Side:\n“… the tragic fact is that the Latin-American rate was six times as high as that of the Anglo-Americans. Why? It is due to improper housing, bad sanitation and lack of medical care in that portion of the city where the bulk of the Latin-American population resides.”\nHe asked the city’s white population to “not be smug” towards this reality, and noted the irony of preserving “Spanish-American culture” while neglecting Spanish-American people living on the city’s West Side: “A beautiful monument to Spanish culture is not half as pretty as a clinic to preserve the living Spanish-Americans, and of course all human beings.”\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure from Folo Media.

COURTESY LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\n\n\nLocked in place\nHispanic families who earned or saved enough money to purchase homes in a different part of town had limited options of where to go next. Manuel Garza, who grew up in Edgewood and participated in the 1968 walkouts of Edgewood High School, told me everyone in the neighborhood understood that for them, the borders of the city were closer than for Anglos. “There was the northern boundary,” he said. “You couldn’t live north of Culebra.”\nIn 1935 and 1936, the federal government’s Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) commissioned surveys of American cities that assessed mortgage risk for lenders. The surveys included “residential security” and “racial concentration” maps of all surveyed cities. Risk was tied to the presence of minorities, which made it harder to get a loan in a majority Hispanic or black area.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figure from Folo Media. This “Redlining” map, created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation, indicates levels of security for real estate investment in San Antonio neighborhoods for 1935 and 1936. Color codes were split into four grades: “Type A” indicated newly developed areas that were considered the best locations for mortgage lending; “Type B” neighborhoods were marked as “still desirable;” “Type C” neighborhoods were labeled as “definitely declining;” and “Type D” neighborhoods (marked in red) were labeled “hazardous” for lending. COURTESY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AT COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND\n\n\n\nThe “racial concentration” maps of San Antonio showed Culebra Road as a distinct boundary with “Mexicans” living south of it. Folo Media found original deed records, between 1908 and 1950, that included racially restrictive covenants, many of which weren’t slated to expire until 1970. The language either explicitly barred “Negroes,” “Mexicans,” or races “other than the Caucasian race” from any form of occupancy except “occupancy of servants’ quarters.” A 1948 Supreme Court case deemed such deed restrictions unconstitutional, but in San Antonio, the land and its people had already been organized.\nBoth public and private institutions played a role in restricting where non-whites in the city could live. Banks, neighborhood associations, and even the city’s government safeguarded areas like Alamo Heights, Harlandale, Los Angeles Heights, Olmos Park Estates and Terrell Heights for the benefit of San Antonio’s white residents.\nFor instance, in 1949, Frost National Bank participated as the grantor on a sale of 36 lots inside today’s Alamo Heights ISD boundary. In the deed of record, covenants were established “for the benefit of all future owners thereof” until Jan. 1, 1970. Section H read as follows:\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Figure from Folo Media.\n\n\n\nOther racially restrictive home lending, sales, and rental policies continued in practice until they were outlawed by President Lyndon Johnson’s Fair Housing Act of 1968. It was not until 1977 that the Community Reinvestment Act was able to target remaining discriminatory lending practices.\nPublic housing complexes, commissioned by Maverick in 1940, provided a safer living situation, but concentrated government housing facilities remained segregated until an executive order by President John F. Kennedy in 1964 prevented racial discrimination in federally funded housing. And the 2,554 units of the Alazan, Apache, Lincoln, Wheatley and Victoria Courts posed another problem: They improved living conditions, but provided no additional income for schools. They also ensured that the city would continue to group its low-income and minority citizens together, preserving white middle class areas where investment and wealth would be protected.\nFor most of the 20th century, virtually no area of life went unsegregated in San Antonio. In a 1984 interview, former Mayor Lila Cockrell noted as much: “Because you can see, you know, when you look back and think that segregation was still a part of San Antonio as recently as of about 20 years ago.” According to several studies, it’s still part of San Antonio today.\nWhich brings us back to school finance. As property values grew in white areas in the late 20th century until today, they stagnated or declined in areas available to black and Hispanic families. By tying school finance to property tax, which is based on the value of the property, the Texas Legislature built an inherently inequitable system. As of 2016, the “property wealth per average daily attendance” (property wealth per student) in Alamo Heights ISD was $1,179,836. Edgewood was at $91,813.\nOver the course of the 20th century, a cycle of isolation, spurred by low property values, would keep Edgewood mired in difficulty. Meanwhile, innovation and wealth spread among its neighbors. The next essay in the series on Texas school finance examines how Edgewood was excluded from consolidation, perhaps its best chance at recovery.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Figure from Folo Media.

    "contents": "\nNote: This story was originally published by Folo Media.\nIn case you missed it: Matt Worthington joined State Rep. Diego Bernal and SAISD’s Chief Innovation Officer Mohammad Choudhury on TPR’s The Source to discuss school finance in San Antonio. Listen to their conversation here.\nForty-four years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that children have no fundamental right to receive an education. If you never knew that, you aren’t alone — people are surprised when they discover this little-known piece of American history.\nIf you’re from San Antonio, you may be further surprised to know that this history was born right here, in the city’s West Side.\nRoe v. Wade got all the headlines in 1973, but just three months after that landmark decision, the Supreme Court reached another landmark 5-4 decision: San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, in which a group of San Antonio families from the Edgewood community lost their years-long fight for equal education. The court’s majority found that the school finance system, which was based on property taxes and resulted in stark inequalities between schools, was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Education finance has been re-litigated multiple times at the state level, but it remains one of the key legal reasons that extreme inequalities persist in American schools today.\nThough I was born and raised in San Antonio, I didn’t become familiar with the Rodriguez case until after I moved to Washington, D.C. in 2009 and began teaching students with disabilities in DC Public Schools. After landing the job, I learned the school had been reconstituted, which meant the district wanted to start over from scratch. Except the only thing replaced was the staff. The archaic facilities and its existing resources were still mostly outdated, incomplete or unorganized. Depending on the classroom, any number of concerns could be found — broken phones, disconnected intercoms, overhead projectors with no light bulbs, computers with tattered keyboards, and ceilings that dripped with bad weather. And then there was our disheveled library, repeated pest problems, and occasional breaks in water lines that left us without clean water for hours at a time.\nWhen I learned about the Rodriguez case, a wave of shock and depression washed over me as I realized that schools like mine were deemed legally acceptable learning environments for children. More difficult was understanding that this reality spanned across multiple decades, starting with a district from my hometown in a case I had never heard about growing up.\nThe case’s roots trace back to spring 1968, when Mexican-American families from the Edgewood District Concerned Parents Association hired a lawyer named Arthur Gochman to investigate legal action regarding a number of concerns they had with the conditions their children were forced to endure. Those children felt the concerns, too, and on May 16, 1968, 400 Edgewood High School students walked out at the 10 a.m. bell. Their protest called attention to antiquated curricula, the mistreatment of students, abysmal facilities, and consistently poor funding.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from Folo Media\n\n\n\nThe Edgewood families—–represented by Demetrio Rodriguez (pictured above), who worked at Kelly Air Force Base and had children attending Edgewood schools—claimed that the Texas school funding methods, which are determined by property taxes, were responsible for Edgewood’s inferior quality as a district. Low property values doomed kids to bad schools, so Edgewood was powerless to change its circumstances.\nThe State of Texas responded by claiming it provided “a minimum” education, which was all they were legally required to do. In the oral arguments, Gochman pressed the court to consider what was at stake if the court ruled in favor of “minimums” and against the Edgewood families.\nAmerica, he said, risked endorsing a dual-class society where some have access to real opportunity and others do not.\nGochman argued passionately on behalf of poor children living in the most resource-deprived school districts of San Antonio. According to news reports of the trial, a victory for Rodriguez and the Edgewood families seemed almost inevitable to those monitoring it closely. Governors and other state legislators braced for what Justice Lewis Powell later said would have been “an unprecedented upheaval in public education.” As the New York Times reported at the time: “Every state has studies under way, and many have passed or are considering legislation to eliminate” the fundamental inequalities in the U.S. system of school finance.\n\nAmerica … risked endorsing a dual-class society where some have access to real opportunity and others do not.\n\nBut the disruption never came. On March 21, 1973, the court ruled against Demetrio Rodriguez and the other Mexican American families from Edgewood. Education, they found, is not explicitly enumerated in the constitution as a right, so it could not be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nYet, even as it denied equality in education, the court said it highly valued education. In the majority opinion written by Justice Powell, the court reaffirmed its contention from Brown v. Board of Education that “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.” The court even described the unjust character of America’s education system. It never reasoned that the way the U.S. funds education was fair or sensible.\nAs Justice Potter Stewart wrote, “The method of financing public schools in Texas, as in almost every other State, has resulted in a system of public education that can fairly be described as chaotic and unjust. It does not follow, however, and I cannot find, that this system violates the Constitution of the United States.”\nThe American education system was not fair. It was merely constitutional.\nSince 1973, we have tried to fix education in many ways. We have tried fixing standards, teachers, school leaders, students, parents, tests, and everything in between. Two fixes we’ve never called for: Amending the constitution to protect the right to an education, and transforming school finance systems that courts since Rodriguez have continued to condemn. To this day, in case after case, courts call our education finance system “unjust,” “Byzantine,” and “awful” — but not unconstitutional.\nI’ve spent the last few months exploring the legacy of the Rodriguez case. It’s a famous case within education circles, but has not received anything near the attention of, say, Roe v. Wade. Even most people from San Antonio have likely never heard of it, just like me until a few years back. But as I’ve learned, both the history and after-effects of Rodriguez are extremely illuminating. The story of Rodriguez has a lot to teach us. Each of those events or conversations provides insight into the present vulnerabilities felt across Texas and San Antonio.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure From Folo Media.
