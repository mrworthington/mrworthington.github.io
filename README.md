# Hi There!

This is the code behind my blog. You might look around and find a better way of doing something than I did, so don't hesitate to let me know!

It's powered by R, Rmarkdown, and the Distill for R Markdown Package. If you haven't already, I would highly recommend checking all of these out. 

#### Here are packages I like and am playing with a lot on my blog:

```
library(flextable)
library(geojson)
library(geojsonsf)
library(gfonts)
library(ggiraph)
library(ggtext)
library(gghighlight)
library(gt)

library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
