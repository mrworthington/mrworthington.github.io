# Hi There!

This is the code behind my blog. You might look around and find a better way of doing something than I did, so don't hesitate to let me know!

It's powered by [RStudio](https://rstudio.com), [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and the [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) Package. If you haven't already, I would highly recommend checking all of these out. 

#### Here are packages I like and am playing with a lot on my blog:

```
library(flextable)
library(ggiraph)
library(ggtext)
