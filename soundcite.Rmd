## Example

The case started when Mexican-American families from Edgewood ISD hired Arthur Gochman and sued Texas for discrimination in a Federal Court. They claimed that school funding methods in Texas were responsible for Edgewood’s inferior quality as a district. They argued, too, that Edgewood was powerless to change their circumstance under the state’s existing funding model, which prioritized property tax as the primary source of revenues for Texas schools. When Texas responded by claiming it provided “a minimum” education, Mr Gochman attacked their inability to define “minimum” and described the consequences of ruling against the Edgewood families as upholding a dual-class society.
