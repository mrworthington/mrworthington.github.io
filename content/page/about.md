Originally from San Antonio, TX, I live in Austin with my wife, Jess, and our family. Currently, I am the Manager of Data & Analytics at [Texas 2036](texas2036.org), where I lead our work around [a series of data products](https://texas2036.org/data/) that we make available to the public. In addition, I serve as a commission member for the City of Austin's [Early Childhood Council](http://www.austintexas.gov/ecc). 

Prior to now, I was the Director of Analytics & Insight at [the United Way for Greater Austin](unitedwayaustin.org) while I finished public policy studies at [the LBJ School of Public Affairs](https://lbj.utexas.edu). Prior to studying at LBJ, I worked in education for several years with [KIPP Austin Public Schools](http://www.kippaustin.org) and at [DC Public Schools](https://dcps.dc.gov) in Washington, DC. At KIPP, I served as the Digital Learning Coordinator for the Austin region. In DC, I taught at MacFarland Middle School in DCPS where I served as a Literacy Intervention Specialist, Special Education Teacher, and IT Coordinator. When I moved to the DCPS Central Office, I worked as the Manager of Technology Strategy in the Office of the Chief Operating Officer. 

Having grown up in poverty and fatherless during adolescence, my policy interests explore the intersections of poverty, public health, and public education. My non-policy interests center around my wife and our family, our friends, our church ([Vox Veniae](http://voxveniae.com/)), getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and [the San Antonio Spurs](https://twitter.com/mrworthington/lists/spurs-watch).
