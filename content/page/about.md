Originally from San Antonio, TX, I live in Austin with my wife, Jess, and our two girls. Currently, I am wrapping up public policy studies at [the LBJ School of Public Affairs](https://lbj.utexas.edu). Prior to studying at LBJ, I worked in education for several years with [KIPP Austin Public Schools](http://www.kippaustin.org) and at [DC Public Schools](https://dcps.dc.gov) in Washington, DC. At KIPP, I served as the Digital Learning Coordinator for the Austin region. In DC, I taught at MacFarland Middle School in DCPS where I served as a Literacy Intervention Specialist, Special Education Teacher, and IT Coordinator. When I moved to the DCPS Central Office, I worked as the Manager of Technology Strategy in the Office of the Chief Operating Officer. 

Having grown up in poverty and fatherless during adolescence, my policy interests explore the intersections of poverty, technology, education, & public management. My non-policy interests lie around my wife and our girls, our friends, our church ([Vox Veniae](http://voxveniae.com/)), getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and [the San Antonio Spurs](https://twitter.com/mrworthington/lists/spurs-watch).
