      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities holds the promise of increasing the means by which scholars are able to analyze and present data. Though some sentiments about the significance of digital humanities might be overblown, there is no doubt that &lt;a href=&#34;http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/introduction.html&#34;&gt;the more ways we have to analyze sources the better&lt;/a&gt;. Learning a variety of the tools that make up the rather nebulous universe of digital humanities is like learning a new language. It opens up new possibilities that were previously closed or necessitated the expertise of others. This frames digital humanities as a collection of skills rather than a means to a predetermined end. I have adopted this perspective in learning about the possibilities opened by digital humanities and working on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jessesadler.com/project/dvdm-correspondence/&#34;&gt;digital humanities project&lt;/a&gt;. I am hardly the first person to take these steps, but I hope that by explaining my thought process I can set a basis for future posts on digital humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there has been one guiding force in my approach to digital humanities, it is to learn skills and tools in the process of production. In a way, this is simply the application of critical thinking to how I create my scholarly work. Instead of doing things in what seems the de facto manner, I have sought to question if there is either a more efficient way or a way in which I could gain or improve my competency. The goal of efficiency was particularly significant in thinking about how to organize my research and writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://jessesadler.com/post/thinking-about-workflow/&#34;&gt;(DH 1.0)&lt;/a&gt;, while learning new skills has been more important in the production of digital humanities projects &lt;a href=&#34;https://jessesadler.com/post/new-kinds-of-projects/&#34;&gt;(DH 2.0)&lt;/a&gt;. This may not be the easiest way to complete a project in the short run, but by doing things the hard way, I am looking to open up new opportunities for future projects. With this theoretical approach in mind, let me now discuss a few concrete principles of my digital humanities practices concerning text, applications, and producing digital humanities projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the basis of all my research is the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text&#34;&gt;plain text&lt;/a&gt;, which I usually write in &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. All of my research notes are in plain text, and I wrote drafts for over half of my dissertation in plain text. Writing in plain text has a number of advantages — which I will discuss in a future post — but an unexpected benefit is that writing Markdown changed my approach to text in a way that gave me a solid basis to tackle HTML, CSS, and even coding.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, Markdown is ubiquitous on the web. This blog post is written in Markdown, and I have made &lt;a href=&#34;https://jessesadler.shinyapps.io/dvdm-correspondence/&#34;&gt;interactive visualizations&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of Markdown for R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, plain text by itself only gets you so far. The power of text has to be harnessed by applications. A major turning point for me in the efficiency and power of my research workflow was the realization that investment in apps, in terms of both money and time, could provide long-term benefits. Using free apps is definitely nice, but if you consider how many hours you spend in an app that plays a significant role in your workflow, the investment is usually worth it. I have come to have real enjoyment in using certain apps. I also think that is is worth while to take some time to learn how to use each app efficiently and even to learn some history about them. There is nothing worse than adapting to a new app only to learn that it is no longer under development. Though there are exceptions, many of my most essential apps have long histories and a solid base of users that points towards continued development.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the tools and choices I have made in the production of digital humanities projects, I have almost always chosen in favor of more control and customization over plug-and-play options. This goal is often in parallel with choosing to use open standards — with plain text being the ultimate open standard — and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software&#34;&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt;, which for me has come to include the use of programming languages such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. Complete control and knowledge is certainly not possible, at least not for me, but more control goes along with my goal of learning by doing. This website is a simple example of this approach. I was never going to be able to make this website by hand, but instead of using perfectly good ready-made solutions such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.squarespace.com&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to make a static website using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Plug-and-play approaches may satisfy the visualization aspect of digital humanities, but they often do little to improve your skills, or at least they are not extendable in the same way that coding skills are. When faced with a decision about how do something for a digital humanities project, I often see an easy way and a more complex route. My approach has been to choose the more complex route. This way is often not overly difficult if you know what to do, but I usually do not have that knowledge, and so the process is slow and arduous. However, the goal is that in completing the task I learn a new set of skills or improve those I already had, making it possible for me to use them in future contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Markdown is essentially a simpler way to write HTML. It is very approachable, but it still has the basic structure of all markup languages or code in the need to properly structure the markup. If something goes wrong, it is almost always because you mistyped something.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;I use a number of apps from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.omnigroup.com&#34;&gt;Omni Group&lt;/a&gt;, which began writing apps for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT&#34;&gt;NeXT&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&#34;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt;, which has been actively developed for the Mac since 1992.

      <title>Thinking about Workflow: DH 1.0</title>
      <link>/2017/06/22/thinking-about-workflow-dh-1.0/</link>

      <guid>/2017/06/22/thinking-about-workflow-dh-1.0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2011, I was in the middle of doing research for my dissertation. I had recently returned from my second extended trip to the archives in the Netherlands and Belgium and had accumulated a ton of notes. I knew that technology had drastically altered the possibilities for research, but the fundamentals of my own workflow were hardly different than they had been when I began undergrad in the early 2000s. Sure, I used the internet to watch Netflix, but the basic tools—centered on the Microsoft Office Suite—were essentially the same. One day, I gave in to the nagging feeling that I was not getting enough out of my computer, that there were better ways of doing things. I started to poke around the internet to see if I could find ways to improve my workflow. What started as a distraction soon turned into a months-long project on finding better tools for conducting research. I quickly realized that the actual process of getting work done, doing research and writing papers, is little discussed in graduate school. Early career graduate students are so busy reading, writing, and generally trying to keep up, that the process of how to do the work is easily pushed to the background. Since then, I have tried to think critically and systematically about my workflow and have often discussed this with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My desire to embark upon a technological odyssey was driven by a very simple problem that developed naturally in the course of research for my dissertation. My primary research involved reading 16th-century correspondence. I used a simple—and I think somewhat commonsensical—approach to taking notes. For each correspondent in the archive, I would create a new Word document and do my best to paraphrase what was said in the letter. As time went by, these Word documents became quite long. After a month of taking notes on the letters of one correspondent, my Word document reached 100 pages single-spaced. At this point, writing in the document became unbearable. It would take almost a minute for the document to fully load. I would sit there and look at the bottom of the window and see the page count go up: 10 pages, then 15 pages, then 17 pages for a document I knew to be over 100 pages long. Scrolling through the document was difficult, and I had no real way to find anything in the middle of the document other than manually scrolling to where I thought it might be; search was a disaster.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My solution at the time was simply to open up another Word document and continue typing. This solution was neither practical nor scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally decided to do something about this issue, it did not take much searching to come up with the solution: text files. I knew that my Mac came with a program called TextEdit, but I had never thought to use it. I began to copy and past some of my longer notes from word into TextEdit. Upon opening the files, I saw to my amazement that they were completely functional in under a second. One hundred page documents opened in a flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple change away from Word to text documents opened up a world of possibilities. It caused me to pause and think. If this way of taking notes was so much better and so simple, why did I not know about it. What else was I missing? It took a while and a lot of trial and error before I found a system that worked for me. I first moved to rich text files, before turning to plain text. But I had begun the process. Plain text proved to be the basis for my research workflow and for what I am calling DH 1.0. Even more significant than the particular solution that I developed was thinking critically about my workflow. I began to read articles and listen to podcasts about technology and Apple. I started to use an RSS reader to subscribe to blogs. And I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/vivalosburros&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. You can obviously go too far in thinking about how to get things done to the point that it distracts you from doing the actual work, but that does not mean it is not worth the time and effort to think through how you do things. One of my goals in this blog and in future posts is to discuss the system that I developed based on plain text files and why I think it is better.&lt;/p&gt;
